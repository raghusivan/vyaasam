It seems like you're trying to extract an IP address from HTML content retrieved from a URL, but you're not getting the full HTML content in your shell script.

To address this issue, we need to make sure that:
1. We retrieve the complete HTML content.
2. We properly parse the content to extract the IP address.

### **Improving the Shell Script:**

Here’s how to update your script to ensure it captures the full HTML and extracts the desired IP address.

#### **Step 1: Modify the Shell Script to Use `curl` Properly**

Let's modify the script to handle these cases:

1. **Create or Edit the Shell Script:**
    ```bash
    nano readip.sh
    ```

2. **Update the Script with Correct `curl` Usage and Better Parsing:**

    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash
    # Shell script to fetch HTML content from a URL and extract the IP address of the latest build number

    # URL of the webpage to resources/branches/pipeline:branch/commsurv:jobs:uat"

    # Fetch the full HTML content from the URL using curl
    html_content=$(curl -s "$URL")

    # Check if HTML content is fetched correctly
    if [[ -z "$html_content" ]]; then
      echo "Error: Could not retrieve HTML content."
      exit 1
    fi

    # Extract the latest build number's IP address using grep and regex
    # Adjust the regex pattern according to the structure of the HTML
    ip_address=$(echo "$html_content" | grep -oE '([0-9]{1,3}\.){3}[0-9]{1,3}' | head -n 1)

    # Check if any IP address was found
    if [[ -z "$ip_address" ]]; then
      echo "No IP address found in the content."
    else
      # Print the extracted IP address
      echo "Extracted IP Address: $ip_address"
    fi
    ```

3. **Save and Close the File:**
    - Press `Ctrl + O` to save.
    - Press `Enter` to confirm the file name.
    - Press `Ctrl + X` to exit the editor.

4. **Make the Script Executable:**
    ```bash
    chmod +x readip.sh
    ```

5. **Run the Script:**
    ```bash
    ./readip.sh
    ```

### **Explanation of the Improvements:**

- **`curl -s`**: The `-s` flag ensures that `curl` runs silently, which prevents it from showing progress or errors directly in the output.
- **Check HTML
-----------

To create a shell script that reads the HTML content of a given URL, extracts the IP address of the latest build number from it, and then prints it, you can use tools like `curl` to fetch the content and `grep`, `sed`, or `awk` to parse the HTML.

Here is a step-by-step guide to achieve this:

### **Step 1: Create the Shell Script**

1. **Open Terminal**:
   Open your Terminal application on your Mac.

2. **Create a New Shell Script**:
   Create a new shell script file named `extract_ip.sh`:

   ```bash
   nano extract_ip.sh
   ```

3. **Write the Script**:
   Add the following content to the file:

   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash
   # Shell script to fetch HTML content from a URL and extract the IP address of the latest build number

   # URL of the 
/resources/branches/pipeline:branch/commsurv:jobs:uat"

   # Fetch the HTML content of the URL
   html_content=$(curl -s "$URL")

   # Extract the latest build number's IP address using grep and regex
   # This example assumes that the IP address format is like '10.xxx.xxx.xxx'
   ip_address=$(echo "$html_content" | grep -oE '([0-9]{1,3}\.){3}[0-9]{1,3}' | head -n 1)

   # Print the extracted IP address
   echo "Extracted IP Address: $ip_address"
   ```

4. **Save and Close the File**:
   - Press `Ctrl + O` to save.
   - Press `Enter` to confirm the file name.
   - Press `Ctrl + X` to exit the editor.

### **Step 2: Make the Script Executable**

Make the script executable by running the following command:

```bash
chmod +x extract_ip.sh
```

### **Step 3: Run the Script**

Run the script by typing:

```bash
./extract_ip.sh
```

### **Explanation of the Script:**

- **`curl`**: Fetches the HTML content from the provided URL silently (`-s`).
- **`grep -oE '([0-9]{1,3}\.){3}[0-9]{1,3}'`**: Searches for an IP address pattern in the HTML content. The `-o` option prints only the matching part (IP addresses), and `-E` enables extended regex.
- **`head -n 1`**: Prints the first occurrence of the matched IP address, which is assumed to be the latest build number’s IP.

### **Note:**
- The script assumes that the IP addresses are in the format `xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx`.
- The script grabs the first IP address it finds (`head -n 1`), assuming it is the latest build number's IP. You may need to adjust the script depending on the HTML structure of your webpage.
  
### **Additional Considerations:**
- Ensure that the server hosting the webpage allows access via `curl`.
- If the URL is protected with authentication, you might need to include authentication options in the `curl` command.
