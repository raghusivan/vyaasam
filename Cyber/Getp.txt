 The error shown in your screenshot, "SyntaxError: 'return' outside function", indicates that the return statement is used incorrectly outside of a function. To fix this, ensure that the return statement is correctly placed inside the function that handles the API response. Here's a corrected version of the relevant part of your script:

import configparser
import requests

# Define the function to get the password content
def get_password_content():
    # Initialize the configparser
    config = configparser.ConfigParser()
    config.read('config.ini')

    # Extract API and SSL configuration from the INI file
    api_url = config['api']['url']
    api_params = {
        'AppID': config['api']['AppID'],
        'Safe': config['api']['Safe'],
        'UserName': config['api']['UserName'],
        'Address': config['api']['Address']
    }

    cert_path = config['ssl']['cert']
    key_path = config['ssl']['key']
    ca_cert_path = config['ssl']['cacert']

    try:
        # Make the HTTPS request using the parameters from the config file
        response = requests.get(
            api_url,
            params=api_params,
            cert=(cert_path, key_path),  # Tuple of (cert, key)
            verify=ca_cert_path  # CA certificate for SSL verification
        )

        # Check if the request was successful
        if response.status_code == 200:
            print("Request successful")
            print("Full response:", response.text)  # Print the whole response for debugging

            # Extract the "Content" which contains the password
            response_data = response.json()
            password_content = response_data['Content']  # This is where the password is contained
            print("Extracted Password Content:", password_content)  # Debugging print for the password content

            return password_content  # Return only the password content

    except Exception as e:
        print("Failed to make a request:", str(e))

# Call the function
password_content = get_password_content()
print("Password from API:", password_content)  # Print the retrieved password content

Key Adjustments:

1. Function Definition: I've wrapped the existing logic inside a function named get_password_content().


2. Return Usage: The return statement is now correctly inside the function, ensuring it works as expected.


3. Function Call: After defining the function, it's called, and the returned password content is printed outside the function.



This arrangement ensures that your script maintains proper structure and flow, handling the API request and response correctly within a function, which also helps in managing scope and error handling effectively.
