Based on the image you provided, here is a cleaned-up and structured version of your curl command:

curl -v --http1.1 \
     --cert-type pem \
     --cert /path/to/your/cert.pem \
     --cacert /tmp/Macquarie-Root-CA-G1.cer \
     "https://wsydasp51850.pc.internal.macquarie.com/ASY-SAFEHOUSE?UserName=rmg_uadrau_dbo&Address=mysql.uat.safehouse.commsurv.syd.non.c1.macquarie.com"

Explanation of modifications:

Removed -0: The -0 flag forces HTTP/1.0, but it seems the server supports HTTP/1.1, so using --http1.1 explicitly is better.

Properly formatted options for readability.

Replaced certificate paths: Ensure the correct .pem certificate file is provided.

Kept -v for verbosity**: This helps in debugging SSL/TLS handshakes.

Preserved query parameters: The UserName and Address parameters remain unchanged.


Let me know if you need further refinements!
