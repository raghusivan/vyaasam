✅ Done:

Extracted JSON data, covering all alerts (open and closed).

Identified key sections: alert_history, alert_audit, alert_status, and message.

One-off code developed to analyze JSON and confirm it contains all necessary data.


⏳ Pending:

Set up a recurring job for automated execution.

Extract data based on a date range.

Iterate through each message and validate alert_history entries.

Ensure closed alerts have matching status and resolved flag set to True.

Maintain database records to track and prepare for the next iteration.


Question:
Should we keep all JSON data in its own file for better organization and reference? Let me know your thoughts!
