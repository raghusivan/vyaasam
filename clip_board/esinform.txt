Team,

Please review the three documents created under es-alert-migration:

1. Technical Evaluation of Deployment Options for Elasticsearch Processing Job

This outlines different options. Please go through it and decide on the best approach.



2. Technical Design Document: AWS Lambda-Based Elasticsearch Message Processing

This details the implementation using a single AWS Lambda instance.



3. Technical Design: Parallel AWS Lambda Execution for Elasticsearch Processing

This is an alternative approach using parallel execution, to be considered if benchmarking shows performance issues with the single Lambda approach.




Letâ€™s first finalize the deployment option and proceed accordingly.

Would you like to add anything specific about the review timeline or decision criteria?
