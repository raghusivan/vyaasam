Here’s your revised message including the meeting note:

Hi Phillip,

Thanks for your message. I've put in the research and shared my thoughts based on what I believe is the most efficient and maintainable approach for a Lambda-based setup. From a technical perspective, I stand by the points in the comparison — especially with regard to performance, packaging, and overall alignment with Lambda's execution model.

That said, I’ve done my part here and won’t be able to invest further time on this due to my current backlog. You're welcome to set up a meeting whenever you're ready, but just to be transparent — I won’t be adding any new points beyond what I’ve already shared.

I’m happy to leave the final call to you and the team, and I’ll support whatever direction is decided collectively.

Cheers,
[Your Name]

Let me know if you want to make this softer or firmer in tone.
