The error you're seeing:

pydantic_core._pydantic_core.ValidationError: Field required [type=missing, ...]

means your Pydantic model has fields marked as required, but the JSON input is missing those fields.

âœ… Solution: Make All Annotation Fields Optional

Open your Annotation.py Pydantic model file and change this:

class Annotation(BaseModel):
    patternLanguage: str
    annotatedText: str
    propertyName: str
    lexiconDisplayName: str
    extractor: str
    extractedText: str
    type: str
    patternText: str
    lexicon: str
    objectType: str

To this:

from typing import Optional
from .base import BaseModel

class Annotation(BaseModel):
    patternLanguage: Optional[str] = None
    annotatedText: Optional[str] = None
    propertyName: Optional[str] = None
    lexiconDisplayName: Optional[str] = None
    extractor: Optional[str] = None
    extractedText: Optional[str] = None
    type: Optional[str] = None
    patternText: Optional[str] = None
    lexicon: Optional[str] = None
    objectType: Optional[str] = None

    class Config:
        populate_by_name = True

ðŸ§  Why This Works

If the JSON you're parsing is missing some of those fields (which is common with APIs or pre-cleaned datasets), Pydantic will fail validation unless you make those fields optional.

Let me know if you want me to:

Automatically update other models the same way,

Print missing fields for inspection before validation, or

Validate only known fields and ignore extra ones.
