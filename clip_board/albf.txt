You need to ensure that the Lambda function response format is compatible with the ALB expectations. Your Lambda currently returns:

{
    "statusCode": 200,
    "body": "Hello from Lambda!"
}

Fix: Adjust Lambda Response Format

ALB expects responses in a specific format with required headers. Modify your Lambda function to return:

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    return {
        "statusCode": 200,
        "statusDescription": "200 OK",
        "isBase64Encoded": False,
        "headers": {
            "Content-Type": "application/json"
        },
        "body": "{\"message\": \"Hello from Lambda!\"}"
    }

Where to Check or Modify This in Code

If your Lambda function is a Python script, find the function that returns the response (lambda_handler or equivalent).

Modify the response to include headers, statusDescription, and isBase64Encoded.

Deploy the updated Lambda function and test it via ALB.


Next Steps

1. Modify and redeploy Lambda function with the correct response format.


2. Test invoking Lambda via ALB again.


3. Check CloudWatch logs for any new errors.
