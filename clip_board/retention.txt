Task Details

As a: Customer

Acceptance Criteria:

Create an app to do the following:

1. Retrieve closed alert JSON files from the API.


2. Create a folder structure based on the alert file's date:

Distribute files into folders indicating years left out of the 10-year retention period (e.g., "4_years_left", "3_years_left").



3. Ensure proper handling of errors:

Log errors with detailed messages.

Channel errors to the appropriate error-handling mechanism (e.g., centralized logging or alerts).





Additional Requirements:

File names should clearly indicate how many years remain out of the 10-year retention period.

Ensure robust validation and error handling throughout the process.

Provide detailed logs for successful and failed operations.


Description:
Develop a system that organizes retrieved closed alert JSON files into retention folders based on their creation date. This system will calculate the remaining years out of a total 10-year retention policy and structure the folders accordingly. Files will be labeled and placed into corresponding folders (e.g., "3_years_left").
