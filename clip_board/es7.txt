Here is a comparison of Elasticsearch 5.x and 7.x queries in a tabular format:

Key Differences:

1. Direct Index Querying in 5.x vs. Parent-Child Relationships in 7.x

In 5.x, alert_status and alert_history were separate mappings, allowing direct queries.

In 7.x, they are children of message, requiring has_child and has_parent queries.



2. Performance Considerations

7.x queries involving has_child and has_parent require additional lookups, potentially making queries slower.

Direct queries in 5.x were more straightforward and performed better in most cases.



3. Query Structure Changes

Instead of querying individual indices (5.x), you must filter child or parent documents (7.x).
