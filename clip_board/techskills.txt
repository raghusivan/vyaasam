I'll analyze the resume to extract the technical skills and determine the years of experience based on the career timeline.

// Define job entries with technologies and dates
const jobs = [
  { start: "2024-06", end: "2025-01", // Current date
    tech: ["Java", "Python", "Vue.js", "AWS Lambda", "Apache Airflow", "Docker", "Kubernetes", "Amazon EKS", "Git", "GitHub", "Bamboo", "AWS", "Elasticsearch", "Linux"]
  },
  { start: "2021-08", end: "2024-03",
    tech: ["Java 11", "Scala", "Spring Framework", "Spring Boot", "Spring WebFlux", "JUnit", "Mockito", "Docker", "Kubernetes", "Git", "GitHub", "Jenkins", "ELK Stack", "Apache Kafka", "Hazelcast"]
  },
  { start: "2011-06", end: "2021-08",
    tech: ["Java", "JSF", "Spring", "PrimeFaces", "JPA", "Hibernate", "RESTful", "AWS Lambda", "Docker", "AWS", "S3", "CloudFront", "Unix", "Git", "Jenkins", "Groovy", "MySQL", "JBoss"]
  },
  // Earlier positions add to the total experience but with some technology overlap
];

// Calculate total experience (from earliest to latest job)
const firstJobDate = new Date("2007-05");
const currentDate = new Date("2025-01");
const totalYearsExp = (currentDate - firstJobDate) / (1000 * 60 * 60 * 24 * 365.25);

console.log(`Total years of experience: ${totalYearsExp.toFixed(1)} years`);

/* Result

Total years of experience: 17.7 years

*/

Based on the resume analysis, here are the key technical skills with approximate years of experience:

Core Languages & Frameworks (15+ years):
- Java (including versions 7, 8, 11) - 17+ years
- J2EE - 17+ years
- Spring Framework/Spring Boot - 12+ years
- Hibernate/JPA - 12+ years
- JSF/PrimeFaces - 10+ years

Cloud & DevOps (Recent 5-7 years):
- AWS (Lambda, EKS, S3, CloudFront) - 5+ years
- Docker - 5+ years
- Kubernetes - 3+ years
- Jenkins/Bamboo CI/CD - 5+ years

Databases (15+ years):
- MySQL - 15+ years
- Oracle - 10+ years
- PostgreSQL - Recent experience
- Knowledge Graph (NoSQL) - Recent experience

Web Technologies (15+ years):
- HTML/CSS - 15+ years
- JavaScript - 15+ years
- RESTful Web Services - 10+ years

Other Technologies:
- Python - 2-3 years (more recent experience)
- Vue.js - 1-2 years (recent experience)
- Apache Airflow - 1-2 years (recent experience)
- Unix/Linux - 15+ years
- Git/GitHub - 10+ years
- Groovy - 5+ years
- Apache Kafka - 2-3 years
- ELK Stack - 3+ years

Application Servers:
- JBoss EAP - 10+ years
- Tomcat - 10+ years
- WebSphere - Earlier experience

The total professional experience spans approximately 17.7 years, with the core Java/J2EE stack being consistently used throughout the career. More modern technologies like cloud platforms (AWS), containerization (Docker, Kubernetes), and modern frameworks (Vue.js, Spring WebFlux) have been adopted in recent roles.
