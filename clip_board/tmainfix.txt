You're getting the error:

ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'src'

This is happening because Python does not automatically include the alert_metadata_downloader directory (which contains src/) in its PYTHONPATH.


---

✅ Solution: Add alert_metadata_downloader to your PYTHONPATH

Before running the test, set the PYTHONPATH like this:

export PYTHONPATH=$(pwd)/..
python3 TestMain.py

Explanation:

$(pwd)/.. makes sure Python sees src as a top-level module.

This works because your tests directory is inside alert_metadata_downloader, and src is a sibling of tests.



---

✅ Alternative: Modify sys.path in TestMain.py

Add this at the top of TestMain.py:

import sys
import os
sys.path.insert(0, os.path.abspath(os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), "..")))

This line prepends the parent directory (alert_metadata_downloader) to the Python path dynamically.

Then keep your import:

from src.main import lambda_handler

Let me know if you'd like me to rewrite TestMain.py with the fix included.
