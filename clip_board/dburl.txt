Thanks for the screenshots. The error you're encountering:

psycopg2.OperationalError: could not translate host name "es1355@reportingdb.dev.shieldrepdb.syd.commsurv.non.s1.macquarie.com" to address: nodename nor servname provided, or not known

Root Cause:

Your host string accidentally includes the username (es1355@) inside the host value. That format is incorrect.


---

Correct Format:

In the connection string:

postgresql://<user>:<password>@<host>:<port>/<dbname>

You must not include the @ symbol in the host value unless it separates the user and host.


---

Fix:

Update your database configuration in Python to:

DB_USER = 'es1355'  # or reporting_ops_dev based on your setup
DB_PASSWORD = '$d3vp@ss135'
DB_HOST = 'reportingdb.dev.shieldrepdb.syd.commsurv.non.s1.macquarie.com'
DB_PORT = 5432
DB_NAME = 'reporting'

Make sure this is your connection code:

db_url = (
    f"postgresql://{self.db_config['user']}:{self.db_config['password']}"
    f"@{self.db_config['host']}:{self.db_config['port']}/{self.db_config['dbname']}"
)


---

Next Steps:

1. Restart your script after fixing the host string.


2. If this is running inside a virtual environment or Docker container, verify that DNS resolution to the host is allowed and reachable from your network/VPC.


3. Optionally, try pinging or doing nslookup to confirm the hostname resolves.



Let me know if you want help validating network connectivity to the database host.
