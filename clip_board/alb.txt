To debug why Airflow is not receiving any response from the AWS Lambda function via ALB, let's check the following potential issues:

1. Verify ALB URL Reachability

Try running the following command from the Airflow server to check if the ALB is reachable:

curl -v -X POST "https://avatarloadbalancer.airflowlambda.avatar.syd.commsurv.non.sli.macquarie.com"

or

curl -v -X POST "https://smartsloadbalancer.dev.smartsalertextractor.syd.forriskmgmblms.non.sli.macquarie.com:4437"

If the request times out, the issue might be:

ALB is down or misconfigured.

Network firewall/security groups are blocking the request.


2. Debug the Airflow Task Execution

Check the Airflow logs for the task execution:

airflow tasks logs test_invoke_dag <task_id> --subdir /path/to/dag/

Look for any error messages or timeouts.

3. Check the Response Status Code

Modify the script to log response status codes and errors:

try:
    response = requests.post(alb_url, json=payload, headers=headers, timeout=30, verify=False)
    response.raise_for_status()  # Raises HTTPError for bad responses
    print(f"Response Status Code: {response.status_code}")
    print(f"Response Body: {response.text}")
except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
    print(f"Request failed: {e}")

If the response code is:

200: The request was successful, check if Lambda is actually processing.

403: Possible authentication issue.

500: Issue with the Lambda function or ALB configuration.

502/503: ALB or backend Lambda is overloaded or down.


4. Increase Timeout

If the Lambda function is taking too long, increase the timeout:

response = requests.post(alb_url, json=payload, headers=headers, timeout=60, verify=False)

5. Check Airflow Scheduler and Workers

Make sure Airflow is running without issues:

airflow scheduler
airflow workers

If a worker is down, restart it:

airflow workers restart

6. Verify AWS Lambda Execution Logs

Check AWS CloudWatch logs for the Lambda function to see if the request is reaching Lambda:

aws logs tail /aws/lambda/<lambda_function_name> --follow

7. Check ALB Target Group Health

Ensure the Lambda function is registered with the ALB target group and is healthy:

aws elbv2 describe-target-health --target-group-arn <your-target-group-arn>

Let me know what errors/logs you find so we can further diagnose!
