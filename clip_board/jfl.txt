Thanks for sharing both versions of your file loader classes. Here's a clean and improved version that merges both functionalities (text and JSON handling), follows Python best practices, and adds error handling:

Unified and Enhanced File Loader Class

import json
from typing import Any

class JsonFileLoader:
    def load_data_from_file(self, file_path: str) -> Any:
        try:
            with open(file_path, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as file:
                return json.load(file)
        except (json.JSONDecodeError, FileNotFoundError, IOError) as e:
            print(f"Error loading file {file_path}: {e}")
            raise

    def save_data_to_file(self, data: Any, file_path: str) -> None:
        try:
            with open(file_path, 'w', encoding='utf-8') as file:
                json.dump(data, file, indent=4)
        except IOError as e:
            print(f"Error saving file {file_path}: {e}")
            raise

Benefits of This Version:

Combines reading and writing of JSON specifically (aligns with the rest of your usage).

Adds error handling with informative messages.

Uses utf-8 encoding for consistency.

Ensures that returned data is deserialized properly (not just plain string).


Would you also like to include support for plain-text files alongside JSON in the same class or in a separate one?
