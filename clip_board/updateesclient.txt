You're encountering this error because the Elasticsearch client you're using (from the elasticsearch Python package) no longer accepts the use_ssl keyword argument in its constructor.

Error:

TypeError: Elasticsearch.__init__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'use_ssl'

This typically happens if:

You're using Elasticsearch Python client version 8.x or later, which has different connection syntax.

The use_ssl, verify_certs, ssl_show_warn arguments were part of older versions like 6.x or 7.x.

Fix

Update your create_es_client function to use the correct syntax for Elasticsearch 8.x+:

Updated version for Elasticsearch 8.x+

from elasticsearch import Elasticsearch
from elasticsearch.exceptions import ConnectionError

def create_es_client(es_url, es_username, es_password):
    try:
        print(f"Creating Elasticsearch client with URL: {es_url}")
        es_client = Elasticsearch(
            es_url,
            basic_auth=(es_username, es_password),
            verify_certs=False,
            request_timeout=30
        )
        print("Elasticsearch client created successfully.")
        return es_client
    except ConnectionError as e:
        print(f"Error connecting to Elasticsearch: {e}")
        return None

Key Changes:

basic_auth replaces http_auth

Removed use_ssl and ssl_show_warn which are no longer valid

Let me know your Elasticsearch Python client version (pip show elasticsearch), and Iâ€™ll tailor the code exactly for that.
