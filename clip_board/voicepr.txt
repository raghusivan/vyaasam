Absolutely! Here's the complete voice DAG code review list with each item directly shown below — including line range, issue, old code, suggested fix, and the reasoning:


---

1. Hardcoded Secret/Config Paths (Lines 40–45)

Old Code:

os.path.exists("/opt/artifacts/commsurv/cyberark/server_cyberark.pem")

Suggested Fix:

os.path.exists(os.getenv("CYBERARK_PEM_PATH", "/opt/artifacts/commsurv/cyberark/server_cyberark.pem"))

Reason: Hardcoded paths reduce portability and break when environments change (e.g., dev vs prod).


---

2. Function Naming Not in snake_case (Lines 55–60)

Old Code:

def retrieveCredential(...)

Suggested Fix:

def retrieve_credential(...)

Reason: Follows Python’s PEP8 naming convention for better readability and maintainability.


---

3. Logging Sensitive Certs/Keys (Line 96)

Old Code:

logging.info(f"CAcert is {cacert}")

Suggested Fix:

logging.info("CAcert successfully loaded")

Reason: Avoids leaking certs to logs, which is a major security concern.


---

4. Unvalidated API Response before .json() (Line 106)

Old Code:

respJSON = requests.get(...).json()

Suggested Fix:

response = requests.get(...)
if response.status_code == 200:
    respJSON = response.json()
else:
    raise AirflowException("Invalid API response")

Reason: Prevents JSONDecodeError when the response is not valid JSON.


---

5. Repeated Cert/Key Loading (Line 114+)

Old Code:

cert = cyberark.get("cert").get("pem")

Suggested Fix:

def load_certs(cyberark):
    return cyberark["cert"]["pem"], cyberark["key"]["pem"], cyberark["cacert"]["pem"]

Reason: Repeated logic should be centralized to reduce duplication and errors.


---

6. Boto3 Called Without Credential Check (Lines 130–135)

Old Code:

session_token = awsConfig.get("sessionToken")

Suggested Fix:

if not awsConfig.get("sessionToken"):
    raise AirflowException("Missing AWS session token")

Reason: Prevents silent failures or cryptic boto3 errors.


---

7. Logging Sensitive Tokens (Lines 160–180)

Old Code:

logging.info(f"Token: {token}")

Suggested Fix:

logging.info("Token retrieved successfully [REDACTED]")

Reason: Logging secrets violates security standards and compliance.


---

8. Writing to Temp Files with Fixed Names (Lines 215–220)

Old Code:

open("/tmp/agent_id_data.json", "w")

Suggested Fix:

with tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile(mode="w", delete=False, suffix=".json") as f:

Reason: Prevents filename collisions and ensures automatic cleanup.


---

9. S3 Upload without Validating Config (Line 239)

Old Code:

s3_client.upload_file(...)

Suggested Fix:

if bucket and key:
    s3_client.upload_file(...)
else:
    raise AirflowException("Missing S3 config")

Reason: Avoids runtime issues when config is misconfigured or missing.


---

10. Repeated CSV Writing Logic (Lines 310–320)

Old Code:

with open(csv_file_path, "w") as f:
    writer = csv.DictWriter(...)

Suggested Fix:

def write_csv(data, path):
    with open(path, "w") as f:
        writer = csv.DictWriter(...)

Reason: Centralizing CSV logic improves reuse and testing.


---

11. Unprotected Temp Dir Cleanup (Line 410)

Old Code:

finally:
    tmp_dir.cleanup()

Suggested Fix:

finally:
    try:
        tmp_dir.cleanup()
    except Exception as e:
        logging.warning(f"Cleanup failed: {e}")

Reason: Ensures cleanup errors don’t mask real issues or crash the DAG.


---

12. No Retry Logic for HTTP Requests (Multiple lines)

Old Code:

requests.get(...)

Suggested Fix:

from tenacity import retry, stop_after_attempt

@retry(stop=stop_after_attempt(3))
def call():
    return requests.get(...)

Reason: Adds resilience to transient network or API outages.
