# Project README

## Overview
This project consists of Python scripts to interact with Elasticsearch. The scripts extract data by ID, fetch messages within a date range, and list available indices.

## Prerequisites
Before running the scripts, ensure that the following requirements are met:

1. Access to the **UAT job server** where Elasticsearch connectivity is available.
2. Python 3 installed on your system.
3. Required dependencies installed using the following command:
   ```sh
   python3 -m pip install -r req.txt
   ```

## Usage

### Extract Data by ID
To extract JSON responses based on different configurations, run the respective command:

```sh
python3 get_by_id_main.py message.ini   # Fetch message
python3 get_by_id_main.py history.ini   # Fetch history
python3 get_by_id_main.py status.ini    # Fetch status
python3 get_by_id_main.py audit.ini     # Fetch audit logs
```

### Fetch Messages by Date Range
To retrieve messages from Elasticsearch based on a date range, execute:

```sh
python3 get_daterange_message_alerts_sql_main.py messageDateRange.ini
```
This script also prints the dates of retrieved messages.

### List Available Indices
To list the Elasticsearch indices in a sorted order, run:

```sh
./admin.sh indices_sort
```

## Notes
- Ensure you have the correct permissions to access Elasticsearch.
- Modify the `.ini` configuration files as needed to specify query parameters.
- Logs and errors will be displayed in the terminal for debugging purposes.

## Troubleshooting
If you encounter issues:
- Check if Elasticsearch is running and accessible from the UAT job server.
- Verify the configurations inside `.ini` files.
- Ensure all required Python dependencies are installed.
