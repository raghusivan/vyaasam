Yes, the described process is technically possible and is often used to implement a self-sustaining loop with AWS Lambda and Amazon SQS. However, you need to be careful about handling infinite loops, cost implications, and message visibility settings.

Detailed Rewrite with Technical Accuracy:

1. Lambda Invocation:

The AWS Lambda function is initially invoked, either manually, via a CloudWatch event, or by another AWS service.



2. Message Addition to SQS:

The Lambda function publishes a message to an Amazon SQS queue.



3. Delayed Message Processing:

If the SQS queue has a delay configured or a message retention period, the message waits in the queue before becoming visible.



4. SQS Triggering Lambda:

Once the message becomes visible, SQS invokes the same Lambda function, assuming it is configured as an event source mapping for the queue.



5. Message Processing:

The Lambda function retrieves and processes the message from the queue.



6. Adding a New Message:

After processing, the Lambda function sends a new message back to the SQS queue to continue the cycle.



7. Cycle Repeats:

This loop continues indefinitely unless controlled through mechanisms like:

Message expiration (Time-to-Live - TTL)

Dead-letter queues (DLQ) for failed messages

Conditional termination logic inside the Lambda function





Potential Technical Concerns and Solutions:

Infinite Loops & Cost Impact:

To prevent runaway execution, the Lambda function should have a condition to stop resubmitting messages.


Visibility Timeout Consideration:

Ensure that the visibility timeout of the SQS message is longer than the expected Lambda execution time.


Monitoring & Alerting:

Use CloudWatch Logs and Metrics to track execution and detect any unexpected behavior.
