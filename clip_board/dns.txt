Great question — Squid Proxy is a widely-used, open-source caching and forwarding HTTP proxy server. It acts as a middleman between clients (like your browser or app) and the internet (or internal services).

What Squid Proxy Does:

1. HTTP/HTTPS Proxying

It forwards client requests to target servers (like shieldfis.com), then returns the response.

For HTTPS, it uses a method called CONNECT tunneling to securely pass encrypted traffic.


2. Caching

It can cache frequently requested content (like images, scripts, pages) to reduce load time and bandwidth.


3. Access Control

Squid can enforce rules to allow or deny access to certain URLs, IPs, domains, or protocols.

Often used in enterprises to control and monitor internet usage.


4. Authentication & Logging

Can be configured to require user login, track who accessed what, and when.

Very useful in secure or regulated environments (like banks or defense).


5. Content Filtering

Can integrate with filters to block ads, malware, or specific categories of content.

In Your Context

Your request is going via:

privproxy.prod.proxy.core.syd.non.cl.macquarie.com:3128

This is a Squid proxy set up in your organization's network to:

Route and secure outbound traffic

Enforce network policies

Monitor and control service access

Possibly log access for compliance


You're using it like this:

curl --proxy http://squid-proxy:3128 https://your-target.com

Why it matters in your troubleshooting

Squid itself isn’t blocking you.

But Squid can’t resolve the DNS (ERR_DNS_FAIL), so it returns 503 Service Unavailable.
