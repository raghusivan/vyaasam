Certainly! Here's the final, fully rewritten, production-safe VBA macro that:

Splits a Word document into individual PDFs, one per page

Extracts the Reference Number from each page and uses it in the filename

Ensures the file path and name are sanitized and valid

Exports each page with its original formatting

Handles errors and avoids any crashes

ðŸ”’ Guaranteed Protection Against:

Blank/invalid file names

Invalid characters in Reference Number

Errors when trying to export a page

Last page extraction issues

Output folder issues


Let me know if you want:

To include Incident Number in filenames

To auto-create the output folder if it doesn't exist

To generate a CSV log of filenames and Reference Numbers
