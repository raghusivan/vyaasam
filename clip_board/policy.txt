Here’s how to fix the issue in your CloudFormation JSON.


---

What’s Wrong in Your Current Code:

1. You are including this line under "Policies":

"arn:aws:iam::828604310598:role/prod/roles/service/secretsmgt/VaultAuthRole"

Problem: This is an IAM Role ARN, but "Policies" expects inline policy definitions, not role ARNs.




---

Corrected Version – Fixes Applied

### Fixes:

Remove VaultAuthRole ARN from "Policies".

Leave "ManagedPolicyArns" (like ReadOnlyAccess) — that's valid.

Define a proper inline policy to allow sts:GetCallerIdentity (for Vault IAM auth).

Correct the "Service" in "Principal": make sure there's no typo — it should be "lambda.amazonaws.com".

Corrected JSON Snippet

"LambdaRole": {
  "Properties": {
    "ManagedPolicyArns": [
      "arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/ReadOnlyAccess"
    ],
    "AssumeRolePolicyDocument": {
      "Statement": [
        {
          "Effect": "Allow",
          "Principal": {
            "Service": "lambda.amazonaws.com"
          },
          "Action": [
            "sts:AssumeRole"
          ]
        }
      ]
    },
    "Policies": [
      {
        "PolicyName": "VaultAccessPolicy",
        "PolicyDocument": {
          "Version": "2012-10-17",
          "Statement": [
            {
              "Effect": "Allow",
              "Action": "sts:GetCallerIdentity",
              "Resource": "*"
            }
          ]
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}

Why This Works

VaultAuthRole is used only inside Vault (as sts_role_arn).

Your Lambda proves its identity to Vault via sts:GetCallerIdentity.

This config ensures Lambda has the right permissions, and the trust relationship is valid.

Next Steps

1. Use the fixed JSON above in your pipeline.


2. Ensure Vault has your Lambda IAM Role ARN in its bound_iam_principal_arns.


3. Redeploy and test.
