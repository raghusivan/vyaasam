Thanks! Based on your working Postman request, here's the final, corrected Python script that matches what you tested:


---

âœ… Fixed Python Script: Submits the request and prints both response and equivalent curl command

import requests
import json

# Sample bearer token (replace with actual)
access_token = "sample-access-token-1234567890"

# Working API endpoint from your screenshot
url = "https://app-52167.shieldfc.com/data-extract/v1/alerts"

# Headers
headers = {
    "Authorization": f"Bearer {access_token}",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}

# Correct payload using startDate and endDate as per working request
payload = {
    "startDate": "2025-02-01 00:00:00.000",
    "endDate": "2025-02-05 23:59:59.999"
}

# Send request
response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=payload)

# Output result
print("Status Code:", response.status_code)
try:
    print("Response JSON:", json.dumps(response.json(), indent=2))
except Exception:
    print("Response Text:", response.text)

# Print equivalent curl command
curl_command = f"""curl -X POST {url} \\
-H "Authorization: Bearer {access_token}" \\
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \\
-d '{json.dumps(payload)}'"""

print("\nEquivalent curl command:")
print(curl_command)

Output Example:

{
  "jobId": "3e56690a-4df4-4a0c-ba45-748f64e7632e",
  "startDate": "2025-02-01 00:00:00.000",
  "endDate": "2025-02-05 23:59:59.999",
  "status": "IN_PROGRESS",
  "jobCreationDate": "2025-04-03T23:24:54.355+00:00",
  "type": "ALERT"
}

Let me know if you'd like to automatically poll the job status or download the result when the job is complete.
