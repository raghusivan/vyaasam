To get the installed version of each package listed in your requirements.txt (i.e., pydantic, requests, sqlalchemy, watchtower) on your local system, you can use the following Python command:

pip freeze | grep -iE '^(pydantic|requests|sqlalchemy|watchtower)=='

Or use this Python script to print versions programmatically:

import pkg_resources

packages = ['pydantic', 'requests', 'sqlalchemy', 'watchtower']

for package in packages:
    try:
        version = pkg_resources.get_distribution(package).version
        print(f"{package}=={version}")
    except pkg_resources.DistributionNotFound:
        print(f"{package} is not installed")

This will output the exact version numbers installed locally in the format suitable for pinning in your requirements.txt.

Would you like me to rewrite your requirements.txt with these versions once you run it?
