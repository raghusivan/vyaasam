Subject: JSON Files for Alert API and ES Index Comparison

Hi Brie,

I have attached JSON files containing messages with alerts retrieved via the Alert API and directly queried from the Elasticsearch (ES) index.

Alert API document: apiMessage_MES-481d7ddd597aa556-1b52c7a400000000.json

ES Index document for the same message ID: esMessage_MES-481d7ddd597aa556-1b52c7a400000000.json


In the ES Index file, I have removed the _source section.

Please review them for comparison and let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Raghu
