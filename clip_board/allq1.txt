Elasticsearch 5.x does not support inner_hits directly in this way. Instead, you need to use the has_child query correctly inside a bool query. Here's the fixed query to work with Elasticsearch 5.x:

{
  "query": {
    "bool": {
      "must": [
        {
          "term": {
            "_id": "YOUR_MESSAGE_ID"
          }
        },
        {
          "has_child": {
            "type": "alert_history",
            "query": {
              "bool": {
                "must": [
                  {
                    "term": {
                      "message_id": "YOUR_MESSAGE_ID"
                    }
                  }
                ]
              }
            }
          }
        },
        {
          "has_child": {
            "type": "alert_status",
            "query": {
              "bool": {
                "must": [
                  {
                    "term": {
                      "message_id": "YOUR_MESSAGE_ID"
                    }
                  }
                ]
              }
            }
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  },
  "_source": true,
  "size": 1
}

Fixes and Adjustments for Elasticsearch 5.x:

1. Removed inner_hits – Elasticsearch 5.x does not support it directly at the top level.


2. Used has_child inside must – This ensures both child types (alert_history and alert_status) exist for the given _id.


3. Querying by message_id inside child queries – Ensures the children are correctly linked.



Replace "YOUR_MESSAGE_ID" with the actual _id you are searching for.

This query will retrieve a message document that has alert_history and alert_status as child documents in an Elasticsearch 5.x index. Let me know if you need further adjustments!
