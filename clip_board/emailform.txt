Here’s what you can fill out in each field of the form based on your SMTP error and recent ticket:


---

1. Details on what has occurred (required)

> We have been using the SMTP configuration to send emails from commsurv.ops@macquarie.com to external recipients via an automated system. This has been working fine until the last two days.
Now, we are receiving the following error when attempting to send emails:
550 5.7.60 SMTP; Client does not have permissions to send as this sender
This issue started soon after REQ000001850391 was closed. We believe permissions (e.g., "Send As") may have been inadvertently removed. Please investigate and reinstate the required permissions.




---

2. Sender’s email address (required)

> commsurv.ops@macquarie.com




---

3. Recipient’s email address (required)

> raghu_sv@hotmail.com
(or any of the addresses you were using in the test run)




---

4. Date and time the email was sent (required)

> Provide the latest failed attempt time.
Example:
22 April 2025, 09:50 UTC
(Adjust based on the actual time your log shows)




---

5. Subject line of the email (required)

> Tester EML
(or whatever the subject was in your eml file)




---

6. Attach original copy of the email (if required)

Attach one of the .eml files you were processing (e.g., from the S3 source), if the form allows.

Let me know if you want a short summary version of the error in case they require logs too.
