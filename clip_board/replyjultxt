Hi Juliane,

Thanks for sharing the details.

I’ve confirmed that none of these message IDs currently exist in the alert index; however, they are all present in the message index.

Could you please action them so that I can monitor if they get captured in the alert index upon update? Also, let me know if you’d like me to share the corresponding message JSONs for review.

Thanks,
Raghu
