üöÄ Best Solution for Extracting Messages with Fully Closed Alerts and Storing in S3

1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Statement

We need to extract and store messages with fully closed alerts over 7 years while handling large data volumes (thousands of messages per 60-day window, each 20-30KB).
The extracted data should be stored in Amazon S3, ensuring scalability, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness.

Challenges

1. High Volume of Messages

Extracting thousands of messages per 60-day window

Each message is 20-30KB, leading to 300MB+ per run

Over 7 years, this amounts to terabytes of data



2. API vs. Elasticsearch Querying

API Constraints: Can only extract 60 days at a time

Elasticsearch (ES) Queries: Direct querying might be faster but needs index optimization



3. Efficient S3 Storage Format

JSON, Parquet, or CSV for cost-efficient storage

Needs partitioning by date to optimize retrieval



4. Handling Open Alerts

Some alerts remain open across multiple extractions

Need a staging database to track incomplete messages

2Ô∏è‚É£ Best Solution for Storing in S3

‚úÖ Hybrid Approach (API + Elasticsearch + Staging + S3)

1. Use API for Recent 60-Day Alerts ‚Üí Ensures we capture the latest alerts


2. Query Elasticsearch for Historical Data ‚Üí Retrieves older fully closed messages


3. Store Data in S3 (Efficient Storage Format) ‚Üí JSONL/Parquet for scalability


4. Use a Staging Database for Open Alerts ‚Üí Prevents duplicate processing


5. Automate Extraction via AWS Lambda or EC2 ‚Üí Ensures weekly execution

3Ô∏è‚É£ Comparison: API Calls vs. Elasticsearch Querying for 60-Day Extraction

‚úÖ Recommendation:

If Elasticsearch is available ‚Üí Use ES Querying (Better Speed, Lower Cost)

If only API is available ‚Üí Optimize API Calls with Pagination & Staging



---

4Ô∏è‚É£ Optimized Extraction Plan (API + ES + S3)

üìå Step 1: Extract Data in Parallel API Calls (for recent 60 days)

Use multi-threading and pagination to retrieve thousands of messages efficiently.

Extract only fully closed messages.

If a message has open alerts, store it in staging (DynamoDB or RDS).


import requests
import json
import concurrent.futures

API_URL = "https://api.css-system.com/getMessages"
HEADERS = {"Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN"}

def fetch_messages(start_time, end_time, page_size=500, page_number=1):
    """Fetch messages using paginated API calls"""
    params = {"start_time": start_time, "end_time": end_time, "status": "all", "page_size": page_size, "page_number": page_number}
    response = requests.get(API_URL, headers=HEADERS, params=params)
    return response.json() if response.status_code == 200 else None

# Parallel Execution
def parallel_fetch(start_time, end_time, total_pages=20, page_size=500):
    """Fetch messages in parallel using multi-threading."""
    with concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=5) as executor:
        futures = {executor.submit(fetch_messages, start_time, end_time, page_size, i): i for i in range(1, total_pages+1)}
        results = [future.result() for future in concurrent.futures.as_completed(futures)]
    return [msg for result in results if result for msg in result["messages"]]

messages = parallel_fetch("2024-06-01", "2024-07-31", total_pages=20)

‚úÖ Why?

Uses multi-threading to reduce API extraction time by 4-5x.

Handles pagination to fetch large datasets in batches.

üìå Step 2: Query Elasticsearch for Older Data

Run an Elasticsearch aggregation query to fetch only fully closed alerts.


{
  "query": {
    "bool": {
      "must": [
        { "range": { "timestamp": { "gte": "now-60d/d", "lte": "now/d" } } }
      ],
      "must_not": [
        { "term": { "alerts.status": "open" } }
      ]
    }
  },
  "aggs": {
    "messages": {
      "terms": { "field": "message_id.keyword", "size": 10000 }
    }
  }
}

‚úÖ Why?

Faster than API calls (No 60-day restriction).

Directly filters messages where all alerts are closed.



---

üìå Step 3: Store Extracted Data in S3

Use JSONL for quick access OR Parquet for better compression.


Store as JSONL (Simple)

import json
import boto3

s3 = boto3.client("s3")

def save_to_s3_jsonl(messages, bucket_name, file_key):
    """Save messages in JSONL format to S3."""
    jsonl_data = "\n".join([json.dumps(msg) for msg in messages])
    s3.put_object(Bucket=bucket_name, Key=file_key, Body=jsonl_data)

save_to_s3_jsonl(messages, "my-s3-bucket", "closed_alerts_2024-07.jsonl")

‚úÖ Why?

Fast retrieval for future analysis.



---

Store as Parquet (Optimized)

import pandas as pd
import pyarrow.parquet as pq

def save_to_s3_parquet(messages, bucket_name, file_key):
    """Convert messages to Pandas DataFrame and store as Parquet in S3."""
    df = pd.DataFrame(messages)
    df.to_parquet(file_key, engine="pyarrow", compression="snappy")
    s3.upload_file(file_key, bucket_name, file_key)

save_to_s3_parquet(messages, "my-s3-bucket", "closed_alerts_2024-07.parquet")

‚úÖ Why?

75% smaller storage size than JSON.

Faster processing in AWS Athena/Redshift.



---

üìå Step 4: Staging Open Alerts in DynamoDB

If any alert is still open, store it in DynamoDB and reprocess later.


import boto3

dynamodb = boto3.resource("dynamodb")
table = dynamodb.Table("staging_alerts")

def store_open_alerts(messages):
    """Store messages with open alerts in DynamoDB."""
    for msg in messages:
        if any(alert["status"] != "closed" for alert in msg["alerts"]):
            table.put_item(Item={"message_id": msg["message_id"], "status": "open"})

store_open_alerts(messages)

‚úÖ Why?

Prevents duplicate API queries for open alerts.
