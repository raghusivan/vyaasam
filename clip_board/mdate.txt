Below is a minimal working query JSON that filters documents by the last_updated field in the specified date range. Make sure your index and field names match exactly as defined in your mapping:

{
  "query": {
    "range": {
      "last_updated": {
        "gte": "2023-01-01T00:00:00",
        "lte": "2023-12-31T23:59:59",
        "format": "date_time||date_time_no_millis"
      }
    }
  }
}

This query uses the last_updated field—defined in your mapping as a date with the format "date_time||date_time_no_millis"—to return all documents whose last_updated value falls within the specified date/time range.
