The issue seems to be related to:

1. Missing pip in Python versions – You attempted to use python3 -m pip, but it may not be installed.


2. Corrupted or mismatched urllib3 package – The expected hash does not match the one from the downloaded package.


3. Package not found error – pip show urllib3 indicates that urllib3 is not installed.



Solution Steps

1. Verify Python Version and Ensure pip is Installed

Run:

python3 --version
which python3
python3 -m ensurepip --default-pip
python3 -m pip --version

If pip is not installed, install it using:

sudo yum install python3-pip -y   # If on Amazon Linux or CentOS
sudo apt install python3-pip -y   # If on Ubuntu/Debian

2. Upgrade pip to Fix Dependency Issues

Run:

python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip

3. Fix urllib3 Installation

Since there is a hash mismatch issue, try removing and reinstalling urllib3:

python3 -m pip uninstall urllib3 -y
python3 -m pip install --no-cache-dir urllib3

The --no-cache-dir flag ensures that the latest version is downloaded.

4. Validate Installation

Check if urllib3 is properly installed:

python3 -m pip show urllib3

If the output is empty, try installing a specific version:

python3 -m pip install 'urllib3==1.26.20' --no-cache-dir

5. Verify pip and Modules Work

After these steps, test by running:

python3 -m pip list
python3 -c "import urllib3; print(urllib3.__version__)"

Let me know if any errors persist.
