Below is a **technical evaluation** comparing several options for running a **one-off Elasticsearch data extraction and processing job**, along with an explanation of why **AWS Lambda** is best suited.
Technical Evaluation of Deployment Options for Elasticsearch Processing Job
---

## **What the Job Needs to Do**
- **Connect to a Production Elasticsearch (ES) index**:  
  Pull messages based on a **date range** or **filters**.

- **Process Each Message**:  
  Fetch **message details** (`message`, `history`, `status`, `audit`), compile them into **JSON** files.

- **Output / Destination**:  
  Store processed files in **S3** (or another persistent location).

- **One-Off Nature**:  
  This job is **temporary**. After completion, it’s **not likely** to be used again on a regular basis.

---

## **Option 1: Directly Running on EC2**
1. **Description**  
   - Spin up or use an **existing EC2 instance** to run a Python script or service.
   - The script queries Production Elasticsearch, processes the data, and outputs to S3.

2. **Drawbacks**  
   - **Approval Difficulty**: Getting approval to run large processes in Production can be tedious.
   - **Risk of Impacting Existing Services**: Heavy ES queries might **slow down** or **crash** other production workloads.
   - **Complex Setup**: If we run on **UAT EC2** but need Production ES data, we face **networking complexities** or cross-account roles.

3. **Why Not Chosen**  
   - Potential **performance risk** to Production.
   - **Intricate approvals** to run a one-off job on a shared instance.
   - We want a **clean isolation** from existing infrastructure.

---

## **Option 2: AWS Lambda (Serverless Approach)**
1. **Description**  
   - Use a **Lambda function** (or multiple Lambdas with SQS) to:
     - Pull messages from Production ES.
     - Process each message into JSON.
     - Upload results to S3.
   - **Serverless** means we only pay for the actual compute time used.

2. **Advantages**
   - **Minimal Operational Overhead**: No server management or patching.
   - **Scalable & Isolated**: Lambdas run in a **separate environment**; no risk to existing EC2 or production services.
   - **Cost-Effective**: Pay per invocation; ideal for a **short-term, one-off** job.
   - **Concurrent Execution**: If using **SQS** as an event source, multiple Lambdas can run in parallel for higher throughput.

3. **Why Chosen**  
   - **No heavy infrastructure** needed (like ALB or multiple EC2s).
   - **Clear separation** from existing Production resources (only the ES query needs proper IAM access).
   - **Easier approvals** (small, serverless, ephemeral).
   - Perfect for a **one-off** job that can scale automatically, then shut down with no idle cost.

---

## **Option 3: Bunch of EC2 Instances Behind ALB**
1. **Description**  
   - Spin up multiple EC2 instances in an **Auto Scaling Group** behind an **Application Load Balancer (ALB)**.
   - Each instance runs the processing logic for parallel throughput.

2. **Drawbacks**  
   - **Higher Cost**: Need to keep multiple EC2s + an ALB running.
   - **Complexity**: Setting up load balancing, instance management, and auto scaling for a job that runs once.
   - **Overkill**: Suitable for a long-running or continuous job, not for a short-term processing event.

3. **Why Not Chosen**  
   - The job is **one-off**; setting up ALB, ASG, and multiple EC2s is **heavy** and **expensive**.
   - **Serverless** is simpler and cheaper for short tasks.

## **Conclusion: Why AWS Lambda Is Best**
- **Ease of Isolation**: Lambda runs in a separate environment, **minimizing impact** on production services.
- **No Server Management**: AWS handles all patching, scaling, and concurrency automatically.
- **Cost-Effectiveness**: Pay only for actual execution time, no idle server cost.
- **Simple Approval & Setup**: Doesn’t require a new or shared EC2 in Production, avoiding complex network setups or administrative overhead.
- **One-Off Job Fit**: Perfect for ephemeral tasks that **don’t need** constant infrastructure.

Hence, **AWS Lambda** (optionally with **SQS** for concurrency) is **chosen** due to its **serverless, scalable, and cost-efficient nature**, fitting this **short-term** data extraction and processing need.
