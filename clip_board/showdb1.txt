To grant access to the alert_job_logs database to all existing users, you can use the GRANT statement with a wildcard to apply permissions universally. However, note that granting access to all users is not typically recommended due to security concerns. Here's how to proceed:

Grant Access to All Existing Users

-- Grant access to all users for the alert_job_logs database
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON alert_job_logs.* TO '%'@'%';

-- Apply the changes
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;


---

Explanation:

1. Wildcard User %:

The TO '%'@'%' means this will apply to all users from any host.



2. Apply Changes:

FLUSH PRIVILEGES ensures that MySQL reloads the privilege tables immediately.





---

Caution:

This will grant ALL existing users full access to the alert_job_logs database, including the ability to modify or delete records. Use this with caution in a production environment.

If you'd like to fine-tune the permissions, it's better to grant access to only specific users.
