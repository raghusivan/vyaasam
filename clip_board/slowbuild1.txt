Summary:

Slow Build and Deployment Times on MAX for Lambda/SQS Apps


---

Description:

We are consistently experiencing slow build and deployment times on the MAX platform, particularly for Lambda and SQS-based applications.

Typical build durations are ranging between 20–30 minutes, and in some cases exceed 40 minutes, even for minor changes. This is severely affecting development productivity, especially when we need to test performance-related factors on AWS infrastructure (e.g., cold start behavior, JSON download latency, IAM access).

Local tools like LocalStack help during initial iterations, but full validation still needs to occur on AWS for realistic behavior.

Recent example:
Build initiated on branch dev for a Lambda/SQS deployment took 40+ minutes to reflect results. This is becoming a bottleneck.

Requesting assistance to:

Investigate potential bottlenecks in build queue or agents.

Confirm whether recent changes in accounts or build architecture are impacting performance.

Recommend optimizations or alternate workflows to reduce turnaround time.
