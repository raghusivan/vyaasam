Here are 4â€“5 focused bullet points for the scanning-related requirements for a JIRA story on Netskope:

Enable configuration of scan levels (e.g., low, medium, high) via environment variables or a config file.

Allow definition of scan scope, such as file types, endpoints, or specific metadata fields.

Support toggling scan functionality on or off for different environments (dev/test/prod).

Log scan results with job ID, summary of findings, and timestamps for traceability.

(Optional) Provide a dashboard or API endpoint to view scan outcomes and current configuration in real time.
