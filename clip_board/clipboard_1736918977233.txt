Hi Saurabh,

Sridhar and I have been working on setting up the Python agent for Bamboo plans. As discussed earlier, we created the feature/agentfix branch from the Bamboo agent branch.

It worked initially after you made some configuration changes in Arturo. However, any further changes made to the feature branch are not being triggered as expected.

Would it be possible to catch up with you to discuss how we can resolve this and ensure the branch is triggered correctly?

Let me know if you'd like additional changes!
