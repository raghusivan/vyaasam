Here's the complete and corrected script for fixing indentation:

Python Script: fix_indentation.py

def fix_indentation(file_path):
    """
    Fixes the indentation of a Python file by normalizing it to 4 spaces per level.
    Ensures code readability and removes extra spaces/tabs.
    
    :param file_path: Path to the Python file to fix.
    """
    try:
        with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
            lines = file.readlines()
        
        fixed_lines = []
        for line in lines:
            # Replace tabs with 4 spaces
            fixed_line = line.replace("\t", "    ")
            # Strip trailing whitespace
            fixed_line = fixed_line.rstrip()
            # Add the fixed line
            fixed_lines.append(fixed_line + "\n")
        
        # Write back the corrected lines
        with open(file_path, 'w') as file:
            file.writelines(fixed_lines)
        
        print(f"Indentation fixed and written to {file_path}")
    
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error fixing indentation: {e}")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    import sys
    if len(sys.argv) != 2:
        print("Usage: python fix_indentation.py <file_path>")
    else:
        file_path = sys.argv[1]
        fix_indentation(file_path)
