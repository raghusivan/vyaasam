To fix indentation issues in Python on macOS or Linux, here are some robust and efficient solutions:


---

1. Use a Python IDE or Editor with Linting and Formatting

VS Code

1. Install Visual Studio Code on your Mac.


2. Install the Python extension (ms-python.python) from the Extensions Marketplace.


3. Open the problematic file in VS Code.


4. Enable auto-formatting:

Go to Preferences > Settings.

Search for Editor: Format On Save and enable it.



5. Install black or autopep8:

pip install black autopep8


6. Save the file, and it will automatically fix indentation and other formatting issues.




---

2. Force Reformatting Using sed

If your file is too corrupted for autopep8 or black, you can normalize indentation using sed.

Replace Tabs with Spaces:

sed -i '' 's/\t/    /g' http_client1.py

Remove Excess Spaces:

sed -i '' 's/^[ \t]*//g' http_client1.py


---

3. Fix Indentation Using reindent Script

Python includes a utility script for fixing indentation issues:

1. Install reindent (if not already present):

pip install reindent


2. Run it on the file:

reindent http_client1.py



This converts the file to PEP 8-compliant 4-space indentation and removes extra spaces.


---

4. Use Vim to Normalize Indentation

Open the file in Vim:

vim http_client1.py

Enable Indentation Fixes:

:set expandtab
:set tabstop=4
:set shiftwidth=4
:retab

Save and exit:

:wq

5. Fix Using Python Script

If none of the above works, use a custom Python script to reformat indentation.

Script to Fix Indentation:

def fix_indentation(file_path):
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        lines = file.readlines()

    with open(file_path, 'w') as file:
        for line in lines:
            fixed_line = line.lstrip()  # Remove leading spaces/tabs
            file.write(' ' * 4 + fixed_line)  # Add 4 spaces as indentation

fix_indentation('http_client1.py')

Run this script with:

python3 script_name.py


---

6. Use PyCharm (Best GUI Option)

1. Install PyCharm.


2. Open the problematic file.


3. Use Code > Reformat Code (or ⌥⌘L).


4. PyCharm will reformat the file and resolve all indentation issues.




---

7. Completely Reset Indentation

If the issue is severe, you can flatten and re-indent the entire file:

awk '{$1=$1;print}' OFS="    " http_client1.py > fixed_file.py


---

Recommendations:

Best Option: Use VS Code or PyCharm for robust and reliable formatting.

Quick Fix: Use reindent or the Python script.

Manual Control: Use vim or sed to adjust and verify indentation.
