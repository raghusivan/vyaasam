Next Steps:

1. Confirm Closed Alerts Volume:

Check with Brie and the compliance team to verify the number of closed alerts.



2. Analyze ES Data Structure:

Raghu to examine Elasticsearch to retrieve closed alerts matching the CSS API format.



3. Retrieve Alerts Data from ES:

Develop a method to get alerts data from the ES index that overcomes the 60-day limitation.



4. Confirm Required Fields in CSS API Alert:

Brie to confirm if any additional fields are needed in the CSS API alert data.




Questions:

Determine Data Retrieval Start Year:

From which year should we start the initial data retrieval? Is it from 2019 onwards?

Note: The first retrieval will involve large volumes; we need an efficient approach to handle it in chunks.


Capturing Historical Status Changes:

Alerts retrieved via CSS API and comments show current data but not historical status changes.

We need further analysis and design to determine how to capture alerts' historical status transitions.

Next Steps:

1. Confirm Closed Alerts Volume with Compliance Team

Action: Check with Brie and the compliance team to confirm the volume of closed alerts.

Purpose: Ensure the accuracy of the closed alerts data for proper analysis and migration planning.

Responsibility: Brie and the compliance team.



2. Analyze Elasticsearch (ES) Data Structure

Action: Conduct further analysis on the ES data structure to retrieve closed alerts data that matches the CSS API format.

Purpose: Align the retrieved data with the CSS API to facilitate seamless integration.

Responsibility: Raghu.



3. Retrieve Alerts Data from ES Index

Action: Develop a method to retrieve alerts data from the ES index that matches the CSS API, overcoming the 60-day limitation.

Purpose: Access historical alert data beyond the current 60-day limit for comprehensive data migration.

Responsibility: Raghu and the technical team.



4. Confirm Required Fields in CSS API Alert

Action: Have Brie confirm if any additional fields are required in the CSS API alert data.

Purpose: Ensure all necessary data fields are included to meet compliance and operational requirements.

Responsibility: Brie.




Questions:

Determine Cut-off Year for Initial Data Retrieval

Question: From which year should we start the initial data retrieval? Is it from 2019 onwards?

Concern: The first-time retrieval will involve a very large volume of data, so we need to devise an efficient approach to retrieve it in chunks.

By following these steps, we can proceed efficiently with the data retrieval and migration process while addressing any potential challenges related to data volume and system limitations. Please let me know if you need further clarification or assistance with any of these points.
