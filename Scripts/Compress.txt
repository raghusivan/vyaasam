To create a macOS script that compresses the file contents by removing all new lines and extra white spaces and then adds it to your .zshrc, follow these steps:

Step 1: Create the Script

1. Open a terminal and create a new script file, let's call it compress_file.sh:

nano ~/compress_file.sh


2. Inside the file, add the following script:

#!/bin/bash
# Compress file by removing new lines and extra white spaces

if [ $# -eq 0 ]; then
  echo "Usage: compress_file.sh <file>"
  exit 1
fi

# Read the file and remove newlines and excess spaces
tr -s '[:space:]' ' ' < "$1" > "$1_compressed"

echo "Compressed file saved as $1_compressed"

This script reads the input file, removes all new lines and compresses multiple spaces into a single space, and saves the output as a new file with a _compressed suffix.


3. Save and exit the file (CTRL + X, then Y, then Enter).



Step 2: Make the Script Executable

In the terminal, make the script executable:

chmod +x ~/compress_file.sh

Step 3: Add the Script to .zshrc

1. Open your .zshrc file:

nano ~/.zshrc


2. Add the following line to include the script as an alias or function:

alias compress_file='~/compress_file.sh'


3. Save and exit (CTRL + X, then Y, then Enter).



Step 4: Source .zshrc

Source the .zshrc file to apply the changes:

source ~/.zshrc

Now you can use the compress_file command in the terminal to compress any file. For example:

compress_file /path/to/yourfile.txt

This will remove new lines and extra spaces and save the result as yourfile.txt_compressed.
