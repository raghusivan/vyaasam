To modify the script to accept direct or journal as a command-line argument and upload any .eml file from the current directory to the specified S3 folder, hereâ€™s how it can be done:

#!/bin/bash

# Check if the correct number of arguments is provided
if [ "$#" -ne 1 ]; then
    echo "Usage: $0 <direct|journal>"
    exit 1
fi

# Set the S3 bucket name
S3_BUCKET="your-bucket-name"

# Determine the target path based on the argument
if [ "$1" == "direct" ]; then
    TARGET_PATH="rmg/shield/emails/direct/new/"
elif [ "$1" == "journal" ]; then
    TARGET_PATH="rmg/shield/emails/journals/new/"
else
    echo "Invalid argument. Please specify 'direct' or 'journal'."
    exit 1
fi

# Function to upload .eml files to the specified S3 folder
upload_eml_files() {
    for file in *.eml; do
        # Check if there are any .eml files in the current directory
        if [ ! -f "$file" ]; then
            echo "No .eml files found in the current directory."
            return
        fi

        # Upload the file to the specified S3 path
        echo "Uploading $file to s3://${S3_BUCKET}/${TARGET_PATH}"
        aws s3 cp "$file" "s3://${S3_BUCKET}/${TARGET_PATH}"
    done
}

# Run the upload function
upload_eml_files

Explanation:

1. Command-line Argument: The script expects a single argument (direct or journal) to determine which S3 folder to use.


2. Bucket and Folder Paths: Based on the argument, it sets TARGET_PATH to either rmg/shield/emails/direct/new/ or rmg/shield/emails/journals/new/.


3. Loop Through .eml Files: Iterates through all .eml files in the current directory.


4. AWS CLI cp Command: Uploads each .eml file to the specified TARGET_PATH in S3.


5. Usage Message: If the argument is missing or incorrect, it shows a usage message and exits.



Usage

1. Save the script in the directory where your .eml files are located.


2. Run the script with either direct or journal as an argument:

./script_name.sh direct

or

./script_name.sh journal


3. The script will upload all .eml files in the current directory to the appropriate new folder in S3 based on the provided argument.
