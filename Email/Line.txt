The code provided in the previous message does not actually send each line individually to the SMTP server as intended because the smtplib.SMTP.send() method does not operate line-by-line in the DATA phase. Instead, it treats the entire message as a single block, which means that each line in the .eml file is not transmitted individually.

To truly send each line individually to the SMTP server during the DATA phase, we need to:

1. Open the .eml file and read it line-by-line.


2. Use the server.sock.sendall() method (which operates at a lower level than server.sendmail() or server.send()) to send each line to the SMTP server.



Revised Code to Send Line-by-Line

Hereâ€™s the updated code that will actually send each line individually during the DATA phase by directly interacting with the SMTP socket:

import os
import smtplib
import logging
from configparser import ConfigParser
from datetime import datetime
import pytz

# Configure logging
class SydneyTimeFormatter(logging.Formatter):
    def formatTime(self, record, datefmt=None):
        utc_dt = datetime.utcfromtimestamp(record.created)
        sydney_dt = utc_dt.replace(tzinfo=pytz.utc).astimezone(pytz.timezone('Australia/Sydney'))
        return sydney_dt.strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')

logging.basicConfig(
    filename='email_sender.log',
    level=logging.INFO,
    format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s'
)
logger = logging.getLogger()
for handler in logger.handlers:
    handler.setFormatter(SydneyTimeFormatter('%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s'))

# Read configuration from config.ini
config = ConfigParser()
config.read('config.ini')

# SMTP Configuration
smtp_server = config.get('SMTP', 'smtp_server')
smtp_port = config.getint('SMTP', 'smtp_port')
smtp_user = config.get('SMTP', 'smtp_user')
smtp_password = config.get('SMTP', 'smtp_password')

# Email Configuration
from_address = config.get('Email', 'from_address')  # Use this as the "From" address
to_address = config.get('Email', 'to_address')
extensions = [ext.strip() for ext in config.get('Email', 'extensions').split(',')]

# Function to send raw content of .eml files line-by-line
def send_raw_eml_files_line_by_line():
    try:
        # Establish SMTP connection
        server = smtplib.SMTP(smtp_server, smtp_port)
        server.ehlo()
        server.starttls()
        server.ehlo()
        server.login(smtp_user, smtp_password)
        
        # Process each .eml file
        for filename in os.listdir('.'):
            if os.path.isfile(filename) and any(filename.endswith(ext) for ext in extensions):
                logging.info(f"Processing file: {filename}")
                
                # Start the SMTP transaction manually
                server.mail(from_address)
                server.rcpt(to_address)
                server.docmd("DATA")  # Begin the DATA phase explicitly

                # Read and send each line of the .eml file
                with open(filename, 'r') as eml_file:
                    for line in eml_file:
                        server.sock.sendall(line.encode("utf-8"))  # Send each line of the .eml content

                # End the DATA section with a single period (SMTP requirement)
                server.sock.sendall(b"\r\n.\r\n")
                
                logging.info(f"Email sent successfully from: {from_address} using file: {filename}")
        
        # Close the SMTP connection
        server.quit()
        
    except Exception as e:
        logging.error(f"Failed to send email: {e}")

# Execute the function
send_raw_eml_files_line_by_line()

Explanation of the Updated Code

1. Low-Level sock.sendall:

By using server.sock.sendall(line.encode("utf-8")), each line of the .eml file is sent directly to the SMTP server, simulating line-by-line transmission during the DATA phase.



2. End of Data Signal:

After sending all lines, we send \r\n.\r\n to signal the end of the DATA phase, which is required by the SMTP protocol to denote the end of the message body.



3. Manual SMTP Commands:

server.mail(from_address) and server.rcpt(to_address) are used to specify the sender and recipient before starting the DATA command with server.docmd("DATA"). This allows more granular control over the transaction.




Why This Works

Using sock.sendall ensures that each line in the .eml file is processed individually by the SMTP server, adhering to your requirement of line-by-line transmission. This method directly sends each line to the SMTP socket, effectively mimicking a raw SMTP transaction.

This approach should now meet the exact requirement to send each line of the .eml file individually during the SMTP DATA phase.
