Step-by-Step Guide

1. Create an AD Account for Sending Emails

Follow the usual steps to create the AD account.

Make sure that the AD account has the correct permissions to access shared locations, if necessary.


2. Add the Account to ACG: ACG-All-Allow-SMTP-Relay

The account needs to be added to the ACG group for SMTP relay.

Ensure that any other required groups or security measures are configured for external email access.


3. Open Firewall Rules for the SMTP Service

Open firewall rules to allow your server to communicate with the SMTP service (smtpauthrelay.lb.macbank).

The sample configuration includes the following IP addresses and ports:

SMTP Address: smtpauthrelay.lb....

Prod IP: 10.134.35.56

DR IP: 10.134.43.56

Port: 587



4. Retrieving Password from CyberArk

Fetch the password from CyberArk by using appropriate commands with your API details.

Example command using curl:

curl -s --cert ./fidessa-prd.pem --key ./fidessa.key --cacert ./....-CA-Bundle.cer \
-X GET "https://cyberark-ccp.lb...../ATMWebService/api/Accounts?AppID=AP012717-PRD&UserName=pr_au_fis_app&Address=NTADMIN" \
| grep -oP "Content\":\"K(.*)+"


5. Sending Emails via Unix

Use the mailx command to send emails:

mailx -v -r "pr_au_fis_app@com" -s "This is the subject" -S smtp="smtpauthrelay.lb...:587" \
-S smtp-use-starttls -S smtp-auth=login -S smtp-auth-user="pr_au_fis_app@......com" \
-S smtp-auth-password="yourpassword" -S ssl-verify=ignore -S nss-config-dir="/etc/pki/nssdb" recipient@example.com


This command authenticates using the SMTP relay and sends an email using your AD account credentials.
