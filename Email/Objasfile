 To directly convert the S3 object to a file, you can use BytesIO. Here's the simple modification:

```python
from io import BytesIO

# Download the file content directly from S3
obj = s3_client.get_object(Bucket=bucket_name, Key=file_key)
email_file = BytesIO(obj['Body'].read())

# Now you can use email_file as a regular file
msg = email.message_from_binary_file(email_file)
```

Or even simpler, you can use the Body directly since it's already a file-like object:

```python
# The obj['Body'] is already file-like, so you can use it directly
obj = s3_client.get_object(Bucket=bucket_name, Key=file_key)
msg = email.message_from_binary_file(obj['Body'])
```

Both approaches will work - the first one gives you a bit more control if you need to rewind or manipulate the file contents, while the second one is more direct.
