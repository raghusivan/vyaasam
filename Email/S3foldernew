To include the additional folder paths (rmg/shield/emails/journals/new and rmg/shield/emails/journals/processed), you can simply add them to the FOLDER_PATHS array in the script. Hereâ€™s the modified script:

#!/bin/bash

# Set the S3 bucket name
S3_BUCKET="your-bucket-name"

# Folder paths to create in the bucket
FOLDER_PATHS=(
    "rmg/shield/emails/direct/new/"
    "rmg/shield/emails/direct/processed/"
    "rmg/shield/emails/journals/new/"
    "rmg/shield/emails/journals/processed/"
)

# Function to create folder structure
create_s3_folder_structure() {
    for folder in "${FOLDER_PATHS[@]}"; do
        echo "Creating folder: s3://${S3_BUCKET}/${folder}"
        aws s3api put-object --bucket "$S3_BUCKET" --key "$folder"
    done
}

# Run the folder creation function
create_s3_folder_structure

Explanation of Changes:

1. New Paths in FOLDER_PATHS Array: Added "rmg/shield/emails/journals/new/" and "rmg/shield/emails/journals/processed/" to the array to ensure these additional folders are created.


2. Loop for Folder Creation: The loop remains the same, iterating over each folder path and using aws s3api put-object to create the folder structure in S3.



Usage

Run this script, and it will create the full set of folder paths in your S3 bucket:

rmg/shield/emails/direct/new/

rmg/shield/emails/direct/processed/

rmg/shield/emails/journals/new/

rmg/shield/emails/journals/processed/


Make sure your AWS CLI is configured and has the necessary permissions to write to the S3 bucket.
