Summary of Attempts to Send .eml Files and Observations

We have been working on sending .eml files exactly as they are, including all headers and content, using a Python script. Below is a summary of the methods we tried, issues encountered, and findings, including reference to the screenshot where the email was successfully sent using a PowerShell script.


---

Initial Attempt with Python's smtplib:

Action: Used Python's smtplib to send .eml files by reading the raw content and sending it via sendmail().

Issue: Encountered a permission error: "550 5.7.60 SMTP; Client does not have permissions to send as this sender."

Reason: The SMTP server rejected the email because the envelope sender (MAIL FROM) did not match the authenticated SMTP user.


Modified Envelope Sender to Match from_address:

Action: Changed the envelope sender in the MAIL FROM command to match the from_address specified in the .eml file.

Issue: The SMTP server still rejected the email due to sender mismatch.

Reason: The server requires the envelope sender to match the authenticated user (smtp_user), not just the from_address in the email headers.


Set Envelope Sender to Authenticated User (smtp_user):

Action: Adjusted the script to set the envelope sender to the authenticated SMTP user.

Issue: The email was still rejected because the From header in the .eml file did not match the envelope sender.

Reason: The SMTP server enforces that both the envelope sender and the From header must match the authenticated user.


Attempted Low-Level SMTP Commands with Sockets:

Action: Used raw sockets to send SMTP commands manually, sending the .eml content line-by-line.

Issue: Encountered SSL errors such as "SSL wrong version number" and still faced permission issues.

Reason: Incorrect SSL/TLS handling and persistent envelope sender restrictions by the SMTP server.


Corrected SSL/TLS Handling:

Action: Updated the script to correctly handle SSL/TLS based on the SMTP port (25, 465, 587).

Issue: Resolved SSL errors but continued to receive permission errors regarding the envelope sender.


Fixed Base64 Encoding for Authentication:

Action: Correctly implemented Base64 encoding for SMTP authentication using the base64 module.

Issue: Successfully authenticated but did not resolve the envelope sender permission error.


Considered Modifying the .eml File's From Header:

Action: Explored changing the From header in the .eml file to match the authenticated user.

Issue: This would alter the original email content, which we aimed to preserve.

Reason: Modifying the email headers is not an acceptable solution as it changes the intended message.


Reference to Successful PowerShell Script (Screenshot Provided):

Observation: A PowerShell script successfully sent the .eml file without encountering the permission issues faced in Python.

Reason: The PowerShell script likely ran in a trusted environment or context where the SMTP server allowed the envelope sender to differ from the authenticated user.

Screenshot Evidence: The provided screenshot shows the email being sent with the desired headers and without errors.


Analysis of PowerShell Success vs. Python Failure:

Possible Factors:

Trusted Network: The script may have been executed from a network location trusted by the SMTP server.

Implicit Authentication: PowerShell might have used Windows-integrated authentication, granting it permissions not available to the Python script.

Server Configuration: The SMTP server might have specific allowances for clients or scripts running in certain environments.



Explored Alternative Solutions:

1. Using a Local SMTP Relay:

Idea: Set up a local SMTP server to accept emails from our script and relay them, handling envelope sender discrepancies.

Benefit: Allows sending emails with the desired From address without altering the .eml content.



2. Utilizing Email API Services:

Idea: Use services like SendGrid, Mailgun, or Amazon SES, which may permit custom envelope senders after verification.

Benefit: Bypasses SMTP server restrictions, though may involve costs and require compliance with company policies.



3. Adjusting SMTP Server Policies:

Idea: Request the SMTP server administrator to permit sending emails with the specified envelope sender.

Benefit: Directly addresses the permission issue but depends on administrative approval and policy considerations.



4. Modifying Application Requirements:

Idea: Change the application's requirements to align the envelope sender with the authenticated user.

Benefit: Simplifies the process but may not meet the original objectives of preserving the email's From header.




Conclusion:

Summary: The Python script cannot bypass the SMTP server's envelope sender restrictions due to security policies.

PowerShell Success Rationale: Likely succeeded due to running in a trusted context with different permissions.

Next Steps: Consider alternative solutions like setting up a local SMTP relay, using an email service provider, or discussing policy adjustments with the SMTP server administrator.

Action Items for the Team:

Review the Proposed Alternative Solutions:

Assess the feasibility of setting up a local SMTP relay or using an email API service.

Discuss with IT/security teams the possibility of adjusting SMTP server settings.


Decide on the Preferred Approach:

Based on organizational policies and resource availability, choose the most suitable solution.


Plan Implementation:

Develop a timeline and assign responsibilities for implementing the chosen solution.


Ensure Compliance and Security:

Verify that any changes comply with company policies and do not introduce security risks.
