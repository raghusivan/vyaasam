======Here’s a response to address the PowerShell vs. Python differences:


---

Hi Team,

Regarding the update on sending .eml files using the PowerShell script versus the Python script:

While the PowerShell script worked successfully, the Python script encounters a client permissions issue. The SMTP server we are using enforces strict security policies and does not permit emails where the envelope sender (MAIL FROM) differs from the authenticated user. This restriction is causing our Python script to fail, as it cannot send the .eml files with the intended envelope sender.

It’s possible that the PowerShell script succeeded because it was run in a trusted environment or network context where the SMTP server implicitly allowed different envelope senders. Alternatively, the SMTP server might have specific allowances for PowerShell, such as integrated authentication, that do not apply to the Python environment.

The SMTP server’s internal policies here are particularly stringent and block any emails that do not match the authenticated user's email in the envelope sender, limiting our flexibility.

Please let me know if further details are needed, or if we should consider alternative approaches as discussed.

Best,
Raghu




Here’s a combined summary incorporating all the details from our attempts, including the latest information from the screenshot:

Summary of Attempts to Send .eml Files as Synthetic Emails

We have tried various methods to send .eml files as synthetic emails without success due to permission issues with the envelope sender on the SMTP server.

Methods Tried:

1. Sending .eml Files as Attachments:

Result: Did not work as it did not meet the requirement to preserve .eml file headers and content exactly as they are.



2. Sending Directly as Raw Content:

Result: Encountered a "client does not have permission" error because the SMTP server enforced a restriction where the envelope sender (MAIL FROM) must match the authenticated user.



3. Sending Line-by-Line with Sockets:

Result: Encountered the same permission issue due to the envelope sender mismatch, even though we attempted to send the .eml file line-by-line using raw socket commands.



4. PowerShell Script (Referenced in Screenshot):

Observation: The PowerShell script successfully sent the .eml file in a similar environment, suggesting it was allowed to send with different envelope senders, likely due to a trusted environment or specific permissions in the SMTP server setup.




Options to Make it Work:

1. Whitelist the Sender:

Action: Request that commsurv.ops be added to a monitored/whitelisted group within the SMTP server to permit it as a valid sender.

Implementation: Use this whitelisted address as the sender in the .eml files.



2. Modify SMTP Server Policy:

Action: Work with IT or security teams to adjust the SMTP server policy to relax restrictions on the envelope sender for this specific use case.

Implementation: Allow emails to be sent from authorized accounts even if the envelope sender does not match the authenticated user.

This summarizes our attempts and provides potential solutions that could allow us to send the .eml files with the correct headers and content without modifying the original emails.

Let’s discuss these options to decide on the next steps.



============

Summary of Attempts to Send .eml Files and Observations

We have been working on sending .eml files exactly as they are, including all headers and content, using a Python script. Below is a summary of the methods we tried, issues encountered, and findings, including reference to the screenshot where the email was successfully sent using a PowerShell script.


---

Initial Attempt with Python's smtplib:

Action: Used Python's smtplib to send .eml files by reading the raw content and sending it via sendmail().

Issue: Encountered a permission error: "550 5.7.60 SMTP; Client does not have permissions to send as this sender."

Reason: The SMTP server rejected the email because the envelope sender (MAIL FROM) did not match the authenticated SMTP user.


Modified Envelope Sender to Match from_address:

Action: Changed the envelope sender in the MAIL FROM command to match the from_address specified in the .eml file.

Issue: The SMTP server still rejected the email due to sender mismatch.

Reason: The server requires the envelope sender to match the authenticated user (smtp_user), not just the from_address in the email headers.


Set Envelope Sender to Authenticated User (smtp_user):

Action: Adjusted the script to set the envelope sender to the authenticated SMTP user.

Issue: The email was still rejected because the From header in the .eml file did not match the envelope sender.

Reason: The SMTP server enforces that both the envelope sender and the From header must match the authenticated user.


Attempted Low-Level SMTP Commands with Sockets:

Action: Used raw sockets to send SMTP commands manually, sending the .eml content line-by-line.

Issue: Encountered SSL errors such as "SSL wrong version number" and still faced permission issues.

Reason: Incorrect SSL/TLS handling and persistent envelope sender restrictions by the SMTP server.


Corrected SSL/TLS Handling:

Action: Updated the script to correctly handle SSL/TLS based on the SMTP port (25, 465, 587).

Issue: Resolved SSL errors but continued to receive permission errors regarding the envelope sender.


Fixed Base64 Encoding for Authentication:

Action: Correctly implemented Base64 encoding for SMTP authentication using the base64 module.

Issue: Successfully authenticated but did not resolve the envelope sender permission error.


Considered Modifying the .eml File's From Header:

Action: Explored changing the From header in the .eml file to match the authenticated user.

Issue: This would alter the original email content, which we aimed to preserve.

Reason: Modifying the email headers is not an acceptable solution as it changes the intended message.


Reference to Successful PowerShell Script (Screenshot Provided):

Observation: A PowerShell script successfully sent the .eml file without encountering the permission issues faced in Python.

Reason: The PowerShell script likely ran in a trusted environment or context where the SMTP server allowed the envelope sender to differ from the authenticated user.

Screenshot Evidence: The provided screenshot shows the email being sent with the desired headers and without errors.


Analysis of PowerShell Success vs. Python Failure:

Possible Factors:

Trusted Network: The script may have been executed from a network location trusted by the SMTP server.

Implicit Authentication: PowerShell might have used Windows-integrated authentication, granting it permissions not available to the Python script.

Server Configuration: The SMTP server might have specific allowances for clients or scripts running in certain environments.



Explored Alternative Solutions:

1. Using a Local SMTP Relay:

Idea: Set up a local SMTP server to accept emails from our script and relay them, handling envelope sender discrepancies.

Benefit: Allows sending emails with the desired From address without altering the .eml content.



2. Utilizing Email API Services:

Idea: Use services like SendGrid, Mailgun, or Amazon SES, which may permit custom envelope senders after verification.

Benefit: Bypasses SMTP server restrictions, though may involve costs and require compliance with company policies.



3. Adjusting SMTP Server Policies:

Idea: Request the SMTP server administrator to permit sending emails with the specified envelope sender.

Benefit: Directly addresses the permission issue but depends on administrative approval and policy considerations.



4. Modifying Application Requirements:

Idea: Change the application's requirements to align the envelope sender with the authenticated user.

Benefit: Simplifies the process but may not meet the original objectives of preserving the email's From header.




Conclusion:

Summary: The Python script cannot bypass the SMTP server's envelope sender restrictions due to security policies.

PowerShell Success Rationale: Likely succeeded due to running in a trusted context with different permissions.

Next Steps: Consider alternative solutions like setting up a local SMTP relay, using an email service provider, or discussing policy adjustments with the SMTP server administrator.
