We are still unable to send the EML files to Shield. Below is what we have done:

    Sowndharya generated the EML files, ensuring they match the ones that successfully worked on Oct 10.
    Joseph compared the headers and other metadata, confirming they are identical to those that worked previously.
    He shared the "from" and "to" addresses where the traffic flows to Shield.
    We’ve conducted all possible testing on our end, but still haven’t had any success.

Joseph will raise a request with the Shield team. Wren, is there anything else we can do on this?

Thanks.
