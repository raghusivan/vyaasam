# Monorepo vs Multiple Repositories Comparison

## 1. Monorepo Structure

```
email-system/
├── .github/
│   └── workflows/
│       ├── main.yml          # Combined CI pipeline
│       └── deploy.yml        # Combined deployment
├── email-generator/
│   └── src/
├── email-sender/
│   └── src/
└── shared/
    └── src/

CI/CD Configuration:

name: CI
on:
  push:
    paths:
      - 'email-generator/**'
      - 'email-sender/**'
      - 'shared/**'

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Test affected components
        run: |
          if git diff --name-only HEAD^..HEAD | grep -q "^email-generator/"; then
            cd email-generator && pytest
          fi
          if git diff --name-only HEAD^..HEAD | grep -q "^email-sender/"; then
            cd email-sender && pytest
          fi
```

## 2. Multiple Repositories Structure

```
email-generator/
├── .github/
│   └── workflows/
│       ├── ci.yml
│       └── deploy.yml
└── src/

email-sender/
├── .github/
│   └── workflows/
│       ├── ci.yml
│       └── deploy.yml
└── src/

shared-lib/
├── .github/
│   └── workflows/
│       └── ci.yml
└── src/

CI/CD Configuration (per repo):

name: CI
on: [push]
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Run tests
        run: pytest
```

## 3. Detailed Comparison

### Monorepo Advantages

1. Development Flow:
   - Single source of truth
   - Atomic commits across projects
   - Easier dependency management
   - Simplified code sharing
   - One-command setup for all projects

2. CI/CD Benefits:
   - Single pipeline configuration
   - Coordinated deployments
   - Shared CI/CD scripts
   - Easier integration testing
   - Build caching across projects

3. Team Collaboration:
   - Unified code review process
   - Shared coding standards
   - Better visibility across projects
   - Simplified access control
   - Easier onboarding

### Monorepo Disadvantages

1. Build/CI Challenges:
   - Longer build times
   - More complex CI configuration
   - Need for selective testing
   - Increased cache size
   - Resource-intensive CI jobs

2. Operational Issues:
   - Large repository size
   - Slower git operations
   - Complex branching strategy
   - All-or-nothing access control
   - Build tool complexity

### Multiple Repos Advantages

1. CI/CD Benefits:
   - Faster individual builds
   - Simpler CI configuration
   - Independent deployment cycles
   - Focused test suites
   - Resource-efficient CI

2. Development Flow:
   - Clear project boundaries
   - Independent versioning
   - Focused git history
   - Flexible team structure
   - Granular access control

### Multiple Repos Disadvantages

1. Integration Challenges:
   - Complex dependency management
   - Multiple CI/CD pipelines
   - Harder integration testing
   - Version synchronization
   - Cross-repo changes

2. Operational Overhead:
   - Multiple repository management
   - Duplicate CI/CD config
   - Multiple deploy processes
   - Security policy duplication
   - More infrastructure

## 4. Decision Matrix

### Choose Monorepo If:

- Team size < 10 developers
- Projects are tightly coupled
- Frequent cross-project changes
- Need atomic changes
- Shared deployment cycles
- Strong CI/CD infrastructure

### Choose Multiple Repos If:

- Independent teams
- Different release cycles
- Different security needs
- Separate scaling needs
- Different tech stacks
- Limited CI/CD resources
