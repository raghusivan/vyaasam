 I see that the error message indicates that the sendmail() method encountered an unexpected keyword argument 'dsn_options'. This is because dsn_options is not supported in the Python smtplib's sendmail() function.

Solution:

You can instead use headers to request Delivery Status Notifications (DSNs) from the recipient's mail server. The headers you'll use are:

1. Disposition-Notification-To: This asks for a read receipt.


2. Return-Receipt-To: This asks for a delivery receipt.



These headers work at the email protocol level, but they rely on the recipient's email client and mail server for support and might not always result in a response.

Updated Python Script Without dsn_options:

Explanation of Changes:

1. Remove dsn_options: Since sendmail() doesn't support dsn_options, we removed that argument from the function call.


2. Request DSN and Read Receipts via Headers: We are using headers such as Disposition-Notification-To and Return-Receipt-To to request read receipts and delivery receipts from the recipient's server. This will request the recipient's email client or server to notify you when the email is read or delivered.



Notes:

Read Receipts: The recipient may have the option to ignore or deny sending a read receipt, so it might not always be reliable.

Delivery Receipts: These depend on the recipientâ€™s email server to support them and may not always be returned.


Next Steps:

1. Run the Updated Script: Test the updated script without dsn_options.


2. Check Logs: Review the console output for SMTP responses and print any feedback regarding the sent emails.
