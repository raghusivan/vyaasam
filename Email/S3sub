To adjust your code as requested, Iâ€™ll modify the logic to extract the subject from the email content and not use anything from config.ini for the body. Below is the modified Python code:

import boto3
import smtplib
from botocore.exceptions import ClientError
import logging

# Initialize logger
logger = logging.getLogger()
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)

# Establish SMTP connection
with smtplib.SMTP(smtp_server, smtp_port) as server:
    server.ehlo()
    server.starttls()
    server.login(smtp_user, smtp_password)

    # List .eml files in the 'new' folder
    response = s3_client.list_objects_v2(Bucket=bucket_name, Prefix=folder_path)
    if 'Contents' not in response:
        logger.info("No files found in the 'new' folder.")
        return

    # Process each .eml file
    for item in response['Contents']:
        file_key = item['Key']
        logger.info(f"Processing file: {file_key}")

        # Download the file content directly from S3
        obj = s3_client.get_object(Bucket=bucket_name, Key=file_key)
        raw_content = obj['Body'].read().decode('utf-8')  # Assuming .eml files are UTF-8 encoded

        # Extract subject line from the raw content
        subject = ""
        for line in raw_content.splitlines():
            if line.startswith("Subject: "):
                subject = line[9:]  # Remove "Subject: " prefix
                break

        # Send the email with the extracted subject and raw content as body
        try:
            server.sendmail(from_address, to_address, f"Subject: {subject}\n\n{raw_content}")
            logger.info(f"Email sent successfully from: {from_address} using file: {file_key}")

            # Move the file to the 'processed' folder
            move_file_to_processed(s3_client, file_key)

        except Exception as e:
            logger.error(f"Failed to send email for file {file_key}: {e}")

except ClientError as e:
    logger.error("Error accessing S3 or sending email: {e}")

Explanation of Changes:

1. Subject Extraction: The subject is now extracted directly from the .eml file content by searching for the line starting with "Subject: ".


2. Email Body: The entire raw_content is used as the email body, eliminating any dependency on config.ini for the body.


3. File Processing: The code proceeds as before with logging, error handling, and moving the file to the "processed" folder if successfully sent.



Ensure that the SMTP and S3 parameters (smtp_server, smtp_port, smtp_user, smtp_password, s3_client, bucket_name, folder_path, from_address, and to_address) are correctly configured before running this script.
