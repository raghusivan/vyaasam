To create a Python script that prints "Hello" and a cron job to invoke it every minute, follow these steps:

Step 1: Create the Python Script

Save this script as hello.py:

# hello.py
print("Hello")

Step 2: Make the Script Executable

Run this command to make the script executable:

chmod +x hello.py

Step 3: Set Up the Cron Job

Edit the crontab file by running:

crontab -e

Then add this line to the crontab to run the script every minute:

* * * * * /path/to/python /path/to/hello.py >> /path/to/hello.log 2>&1

Replace /path/to/python with the path to your Python interpreter (e.g., /usr/bin/python3) and /path/to/hello.py with the full path to hello.py. The >> /path/to/hello.log 2>&1 portion saves the output and any errors to a log file.

This setup will ensure that hello.py is executed every minute and logs its output to hello.log.
