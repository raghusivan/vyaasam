Here's a Unix shell script that lists and moves all files with a timestamp ending in 22:53 to a new folder named analysis. The script assumes the files are in the current directory.

#!/bin/bash

# Define the target folder
TARGET_FOLDER="analysis"

# Create the analysis folder if it doesn't exist
mkdir -p "$TARGET_FOLDER"

# List and move files with timestamp ending in "22:53"
for file in $(ls -l | grep "22:53" | awk '{print $9}'); do
    echo "Moving file: $file"
    mv "$file" "$TARGET_FOLDER/"
done

echo "Files with timestamp ending in 22:53 have been moved to the analysis folder."

Explanation of the Script:

1. Define Target Folder: Sets TARGET_FOLDER to "analysis".


2. Create Folder: mkdir -p creates the analysis folder if it doesn't already exist.


3. List and Move Files: ls -l | grep "22:53" | awk '{print $9}' finds files with 22:53 in their timestamp, and the loop moves each file to the analysis folder.


4. Confirmation Message: After moving, it prints a confirmation.



Usage:

Save this script to a file, e.g., move_files.sh.

Run with bash move_files.sh.


Ensure that you have the necessary permissions to move the files and that the directory structure matches.
