The error shown indicates that the amazon-linux-extras command is failing, likely due to a corrupted or outdated catalog or an issue with the environment.

Hereâ€™s an alternative approach to bypass the error and manually install OpenSSL:

Updated Script: Manual Precompiled OpenSSL Installation

#!/bin/bash

# Exit on any failure
set -e

# Define OpenSSL version and installation directory
OPENSSL_VERSION="1.1.1v"
OPENSSL_DIR="/usr/local/openssl"

echo "Installing OpenSSL using precompiled binary..."

# Step 1: Install required dependencies
echo "Installing dependencies..."
sudo yum groupinstall -y "Development Tools"
sudo yum install -y gcc gcc-c++ make tar zlib-devel wget

# Step 2: Download precompiled OpenSSL binary
echo "Downloading precompiled OpenSSL binary..."
cd /usr/local/src || exit 1
sudo wget https://github.com/openssl/openssl/releases/download/OpenSSL_1_1_1v/openssl-1.1.1v-linux-x64.tar.gz -O openssl.tar.gz

# Step 3: Extract and move OpenSSL to the installation directory
echo "Extracting and installing OpenSSL..."
sudo tar -xvzf openssl.tar.gz
sudo mv openssl-1.1.1v ${OPENSSL_DIR}

# Step 4: Update system paths
echo "Updating system paths..."
export PATH=${OPENSSL_DIR}/bin:$PATH
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${OPENSSL_DIR}/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

# Step 5: Verify OpenSSL installation
echo "Verifying OpenSSL installation..."
openssl version

echo "OpenSSL installed successfully!"

How to Run This Script:

1. Save the script to a file, e.g., manual_install_openssl.sh.


2. Make it executable:

chmod +x manual_install_openssl.sh


3. Run the script:

./manual_install_openssl.sh




---

What This Script Does:

1. Installs Dependencies:

Ensures the required build tools and libraries are available.



2. Downloads a Precompiled OpenSSL Binary:

Fetches the precompiled OpenSSL 1.1.1v binary from GitHub.



3. Installs OpenSSL:

Moves the precompiled OpenSSL files to /usr/local/openssl.



4. Updates System Paths:

Temporarily sets PATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH to prioritize the new OpenSSL.



5. Verifies Installation:

Confirms that OpenSSL 1.1.1v is installed and accessible.





---

If the Issue Persists:

1. Manually check whether the OpenSSL version has been installed correctly:

openssl version


2. Ensure the paths are updated:

echo $PATH
echo $LD_LIBRARY_PATH


3. If needed, persist the paths by adding them to ~/.bashrc:

echo "export PATH=${OPENSSL_DIR}/bin:\$PATH" >> ~/.bashrc
echo "export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${OPENSSL_DIR}/lib:\$LD_LIBRARY_PATH" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc



Let me know if this resolves the issue!
