 To list .eml files that don't contain any of the specified recipients, you can modify the previous script to track files that lack all expected recipients. Here’s how to do it:

import os
import email
from email.policy import default

# Recipients list from the image
expected_recipients = {
    "Galadriel Forest", "Boromir Gondor", "Saruman Tower",
    "Frodo Ringbearer", "Sauron Eye", "Gandalf White",
    "Gimli Warrior", "Bilbo.Baggins@test-macquarie.com", "Aaron Aragorn"
}

# Directory containing the .eml files
eml_directory = "/path/to/eml/files"

# Function to extract recipient names/emails from .eml file
def extract_recipients_from_eml(file_path):
    recipients = set()
    with open(file_path, 'r') as f:
        msg = email.message_from_file(f, policy=default)
        if "To" in msg:
            recipients = set(msg["To"].split(", "))
    return {recipient.strip() for recipient in recipients}

# List to track files without any expected recipients
files_without_expected_recipients = []

for filename in os.listdir(eml_directory):
    if filename.endswith(".eml"):
        file_path = os.path.join(eml_directory, filename)
        recipients_in_file = extract_recipients_from_eml(file_path)

        # Check if there's no intersection with expected recipients
        if not recipients_in_file.intersection(expected_recipients):
            files_without_expected_recipients.append(filename)

# Output results
if files_without_expected_recipients:
    print("Files without any of the specified recipients:")
    for file in files_without_expected_recipients:
        print(file)
else:
    print("All files contain at least one of the specified recipients.")

Explanation of the Script

1. Define Expected Recipients: A set of recipients from the provided image.


2. Extract Recipients from .eml Files: For each .eml file, retrieves the "To" field as a set.


3. Check for Missing Expected Recipients: Compares recipients in the .eml file with the expected recipients. If there’s no overlap, the file is added to the list of files without expected recipients.


4. Output: Lists .eml files that don't contain any of the specified recipients.



Usage

1. Replace "/path/to/eml/files" with the path where the .eml files are stored.


2. Run the script to see which .eml files lack any of the expected recipients.
