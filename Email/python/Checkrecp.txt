To create a script that compares the recipients in the provided list with those in .eml files, here’s an outline for the approach:

1. Extract Recipient List: First, create a list of recipients based on the provided image. This includes names like "Galadriel Forest," "Boromir Gondor," etc.


2. Parse .eml Files for Recipients: Open and parse each .eml file to extract the "To" field, which contains the recipient email or name.


3. Compare Recipients: Check if each recipient in the provided list has a match in any .eml file. If not, add it to a "no match" list.



Here’s a Python script that could help:

import os
import email
from email.policy import default

# Recipients list from the image
expected_recipients = [
    "Galadriel Forest", "Boromir Gondor", "Saruman Tower",
    "Frodo Ringbearer", "Sauron Eye", "Gandalf White",
    "Gimli Warrior", "Bilbo.Baggins@test-macquarie.com", "Aaron Aragorn"
]

# Directory containing the .eml files
eml_directory = "/path/to/eml/files"

# Function to extract recipient names/emails from .eml file
def extract_recipients_from_eml(file_path):
    recipients = []
    with open(file_path, 'r') as f:
        msg = email.message_from_file(f, policy=default)
        if "To" in msg:
            recipients = msg["To"].split(", ")
    return [recipient.strip() for recipient in recipients]

# Gather all recipients found in .eml files
found_recipients = set()
for filename in os.listdir(eml_directory):
    if filename.endswith(".eml"):
        file_path = os.path.join(eml_directory, filename)
        recipients = extract_recipients_from_eml(file_path)
        found_recipients.update(recipients)

# Check for missing recipients
missing_recipients = [recipient for recipient in expected_recipients if recipient not in found_recipients]

# Output results
if missing_recipients:
    print("Recipients not found in any .eml files:")
    for recipient in missing_recipients:
        print(recipient)
else:
    print("All recipients matched in the .eml files.")

Explanation of the Script

1. Define Expected Recipients: This list should be filled based on the provided names from the image.


2. Extract Recipients from .eml Files: Opens each .eml file and retrieves the "To" field.


3. Comparison: Cross-checks recipients from the .eml files with the expected list and identifies missing entries.


4. Output: Prints recipients from the original list that aren’t found in any .eml file.



Usage

1. Replace "/path/to/eml/files" with the path where the .eml files are stored.


2. Run the script. It will print out any names from the expected list that don't match recipients in any .eml files.
