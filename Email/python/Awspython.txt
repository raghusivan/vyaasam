 Hereâ€™s an updated version of the iii
AWS::CloudFormation::Init configuration that adds logging to a file (/var/log/python3_install.log) to capture output and errors during the Python 3.12 installation process.

"AWS::CloudFormation::Init": {
  "app": {
    "commands": {
      "01_install_python3_12_dependencies": {
        "command": "yum install -y gcc openssl-devel bzip2-devel libffi-devel zlib-devel >> /var/log/python3_install.log 2>&1",
        "cwd": "/tmp",
        "waitAfterCompletion": "0",
        "ignoreErrors": "false"
      },
      "02_download_python3_12": {
        "command": "curl -O https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.12.0/Python-3.12.0.tgz >> /var/log/python3_install.log 2>&1",
        "cwd": "/tmp",
        "waitAfterCompletion": "0",

    }
  }
}

Explanation

Log File: All output and errors are redirected to /var/log/python3_install.log.

>> /var/log/python3_install.log 2>&1 appends both standard output and errors to the log file.


Commands:

Each command logs its output and errors to /var/log/python3_install.log, providing a complete record of the installation process.



Verifying the Log

After logging into the EC2 instance, you can check the installation log to see if any errors occurred during the setup:

cat /var/log/python3_install.log

This will display the contents of the log file, including any errors encountered during the installation of dependencies, downloading, extracting, and compiling Python 3.12. You can also use tail -f /var/log/python3_install.log to monitor the log in real-time if needed.
