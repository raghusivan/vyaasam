Explanation of Each Command

1. 001: Creates the directory /arturo/. This command was already provided and left unchanged.


2. 002: Installs the dependencies required to build Python 3.12, such as gcc, openssl-devel, bzip2-devel, libffi-devel, and zlib-devel. Logs output and errors to /var/log/python3_install.log.


3. 003: Downloads the Python 3.12 source tarball from the official Python website. Logs output and errors to /var/log/python3_install.log.


4. 004: Extracts the downloaded tarball (Python-3.12.0.tgz). Logs output and errors to /var/log/python3_install.log.


5. 005: Configures, compiles, and installs Python 3.12 using make altinstall, which installs it as python3.12 to avoid overwriting other versions of Python. Logs output and errors to /var/log/python3_install.log.



Verifying Installation

After deployment, you can verify that Python 3.12 was installed correctly by checking the log file:

cat /var/log/python3_install.log

Or by running:

python3.12 --version

This setup ensures each step is properly logged and provides a clear path to troubleshoot any issues during the installation process.
