______ The issue you're facing, ModuleNotFoundError: No module named '_ssl', suggests that Python was compiled without SSL support. This usually happens because the necessary libraries for SSL (such as OpenSSL) were not available at build time. To resolve this, follow these steps:

Fixed Commands for JSON

Hereâ€™s the updated set of commands in your JSON configuration to ensure Python is built with SSL support:

                }
            }
        }
    }
}

Key Fixes:

1. Install OpenSSL Development Libraries: The command sudo yum install -y openssl-devel ensures the required libraries are available.


2. Explicit SSL Path in Configuration: The --with-openssl=/usr/lib/ssl flag ensures Python's configure script can locate OpenSSL.


3. Added Dependencies: Added libuuid-devel and xz-devel, which are commonly required for modern Python builds.


4. Ensure Proper Logging: All outputs are redirected to /var/log/python3_install.log for debugging.



Verification Steps

1. After installation, verify that _ssl is working:

python3.12 -c "import ssl; print(ssl.OPENSSL_VERSION)"


2. If successful, it should print the OpenSSL version.



If this doesn't resolve the issue, let me know, and we can debug further!
