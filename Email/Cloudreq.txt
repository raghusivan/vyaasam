Here's an extended version of your request that includes a diagram component (which you can add later) and a query for estimated time or availability of resources. You can mention the need for time estimation and attach a basic flow diagram in your email as well.

Subject: Request for Guidance and Time Estimates for Using Static IP with Lambda to Send Emails via SMTP

Hi [Cloud Team],

We are currently working on a requirement where AWS Lambda needs to send emails to Shield via an SMTP server. The SMTP server requires us to use a static IP for whitelisting purposes. Below are two possible approaches we are considering. I’d like to gather your insights on feasibility, time estimates, and if we’ve implemented these previously.

I've attached a flow diagram to illustrate each approach, and I'd appreciate it if you could advise on the required time or resources for setting this up.

Flow Diagram Overview:

Please find attached a simple flow diagram that outlines each of the two approaches:

Approach 1: Lambda with NAT Gateway

Approach 2: Lambda using ENI (Elastic Network Interface)

Approach 1: Lambda to Use NAT Gateway

Flow:

The Lambda function is placed in a VPC.

A NAT Gateway is set up with an Elastic IP.

The NAT Gateway's static IP will route outgoing traffic from Lambda to the SMTP server.

The Elastic IP will be whitelisted on the SMTP server.


Questions:

1. Is this approach feasible, and do we have any previous implementations of Lambda with a NAT Gateway in place?


2. Can we proceed with this setup? Are there any additional considerations in terms of security groups, route tables, or firewall rules?


3. How long do you estimate the setup will take, including testing and validation?

Approach 2: Using Elastic Network Interface (ENI)

Flow:

Based on documentation, it seems feasible to use an Elastic Network Interface (ENI) to allow Lambda to communicate with external services while maintaining a static IP.

The ENI would act as an entry point for the Lambda function's traffic, enabling outgoing traffic to be tied to a specific IP address.


Questions:

1. Is using ENI an option in our environment, and have we successfully implemented it for Lambda in the past?


2. Will this method allow us to maintain a static IP address for outbound connections to the SMTP server?


3. How much time would it take to set this up and verify the functionality with our SMTP server?





---

Time Estimation and Current Status:

Can you provide an estimate of the time required to implement each approach?

Do we already have resources available to execute either approach, or will we need additional setup time?

Thank you for your support. Please let me know if further clarification or details are needed from our side.

Diagram:

You can create a simple flow diagram using tools like Lucidchart, Draw.io, or Microsoft Visio to illustrate the following flows:

Approach 1: Lambda with NAT Gateway:

1. Lambda Function (VPC) → Private Subnet → NAT Gateway (Elastic IP) → SMTP Server.



Approach 2: Lambda with ENI:

1. Lambda Function (VPC) → ENI (Elastic IP) → SMTP Server.



By sending this version of the request, you'll clearly communicate the technical needs and help the cloud team assess the required time for each approach. Once the cloud team provides feedback on feasibility and time estimates, you'll be in a better position to decide which path to proceed with. Let me know if you need any further assistance with the flow diagrams or any additional details.
