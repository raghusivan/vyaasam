To list the latest files modified in the Email folder of your GitHub repository using a Linux command line, you can use the GitHub REST API with curl and jq (for JSON processing).

Here’s a command that fetches the latest commits for the Email folder and lists files modified within those commits:

Requirements

curl: For making HTTP requests.

jq: For parsing JSON data. Install it with sudo apt-get install jq or sudo yum install jq if it’s not already installed.


Command

# Set variables
REPO_OWNER="raghusivan"
REPO_NAME="vyaasam"
FOLDER_PATH="Email"
TIME_FILTER="1 hour ago"  # Customize the time filter if needed

# Fetch latest commits for the specified folder
curl -s "https://api.github.com/repos/$REPO_OWNER/$REPO_NAME/commits?path=$FOLDER_PATH" |
jq -r '.[] | select(.commit.committer.date >= "'$(date -u --date="$TIME_FILTER" +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)'") | .commit.committer.date + " " + .commit.message + " " + .sha' |
while read -r date message sha; do
    echo "Date: $date"
    echo "Commit Message: $message"
    echo "Files modified:"
    curl -s "https://api.github.com/repos/$REPO_OWNER/$REPO_NAME/commits/$sha" |
    jq -r '.files[] | select(.filename | startswith("'"$FOLDER_PATH"'")) | .filename'
    echo "------------------------"
done

Explanation

1. Variables:

REPO_OWNER: GitHub username or organization name (raghusivan).

REPO_NAME: Name of the repository (vyaasam).

FOLDER_PATH: Folder you want to filter commits for (Email).

TIME_FILTER: Time filter to get commits within the last hour (adjust as needed).



2. Get Latest Commits:

curl fetches the latest commits for the specified folder from GitHub’s REST API.

The API URL used is https://api.github.com/repos/$REPO_OWNER/$REPO_NAME/commits?path=$FOLDER_PATH.



3. Filter Commits by Time:

jq filters commits that were committed within the last hour (based on TIME_FILTER).

It then extracts the commit date, message, and SHA for each relevant commit.



4. List Files Changed:

For each commit, curl fetches the detailed list of files changed using the commit’s SHA.

It then filters files to only include those in the specified folder (Email).



5. Output:

The script outputs each commit’s date, message, and the list of modified files.




Running the Command

1. Paste the entire command in your Linux terminal.


2. Adjust TIME_FILTER as needed (e.g., "2 hours ago").


3. The output will display files modified in the Email folder within the last hour, along with commit details.



This approach avoids cloning the repository and lists recent changes directly from GitHub.
