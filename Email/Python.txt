Here’s an updated Python script tailored to first send the journal emails to a self-provided email ID, picking the journal files from a local directory. The script ensures that it reads journal files, sends them as email content, and uses Python 3.12. Additionally, I’ve listed the required dependencies.

Modified Python Script:

import subprocess
import time
import os
import glob

def send_email(recipient_email, subject, body, smtp_user, smtp_password):
    """
    Sends an email to the specified recipient using the mailx command via SMTP relay.
    """
    mailx_cmd = f"""
    echo '{body}' | mailx -v \
    -r '{smtp_user}' \
    -s '{subject}' \
    -S smtp="smtpauthrelay.lb.macbank:587" \
    -S smtp-use-starttls \
    -S smtp-auth=login \
    -S smtp-auth-user="{smtp_user}" \
    -S smtp-auth-password="{smtp_password}" \
    -S ssl-verify=ignore \
    -S nss-config-dir="/etc/pki/nssdb" \
    {recipient_email}
    """
    
    # Execute the mailx command to send the email
    process = subprocess.Popen(mailx_cmd, shell=True, stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.PIPE)
    stdout, stderr = process.communicate()
    
    if process.returncode == 0:
        print(f"Email successfully sent to {recipient_email}")
    else:
        print(f"Failed to send email to {recipient_email}. Error: {stderr.decode('utf-8')}")


def load_journals_from_directory(directory):
    """
    Load journal files from the given directory.
    Assumes journal files are in plain text format for simplicity.
    """
    journal_files = glob.glob(os.path.join(directory, "*.txt"))  # Adjust file type as per your files
    journals_content = {}
    for journal_file in journal_files:
        with open(journal_file, "r") as file:
            journals_content[journal_file] = file.read()
    return journals_content


def send_journal_emails_to_self(directory, recipient_email, smtp_user, smtp_password, throttle=0.5):
    """
    Sends journal emails to self (given email ID) by picking journal files from the given directory.
    """
    journals = load_journals_from_directory(directory)
    
    for journal_file, journal_content in journals.items():
        subject = f"Journal from {os.path.basename(journal_file)}"
        body = journal_content
        
        # Send the email with the journal content as body
        send_email(recipient_email, subject, body, smtp_user, smtp_password)
        
        # Add throttling to avoid overwhelming the SMTP relay
        time.sleep(throttle)


# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    smtp_user = "pr_au_fis_app@macquarie.com"
    smtp_password = "your_smtp_password"  # Retrieve securely, such as from CyberArk

    # Email details
    recipient_email = "your_email@example.com"  # Set this to your own email address
    journal_directory = "/path/to/your/local/journals"  # Update this path to your local journal folder

    # Send journal emails to self
    send_journal_emails_to_self(journal_directory, recipient_email, smtp_user, smtp_password)

Explanation of Modifications:

1. load_journals_from_directory:

This function reads all journal files from the specified directory. It assumes journal files are text-based (e.g., .txt), but you can modify it based on the actual file format.

The function uses glob to locate all text files and loads the content of each journal into a dictionary (journals_content).



2. send_journal_emails_to_self:

This function loops through each journal file found in the directory, extracting its content, and sends it via email.

The email's subject is set to the name of the journal file, while the content of the file is used as the email body.



3. Main Execution Block:

Set your own email as the recipient (recipient_email).

Specify the local directory where the journal files are stored (journal_directory).

The script sends each journal file as a separate email to the specified email address.



4. Throttling:

As with the original script, a small delay (time.sleep(0.5)) is added between emails to avoid overwhelming the SMTP server.




Dependencies:

You need to ensure that Python 3.12 is installed and available for use. Also, the following dependencies will be required:

1. Python 3.12.x (You can check your Python version by running python --version):

Ensure Python 3.12 is installed by following official instructions here.



2. Subprocess Module (Standard Library):

This is used to execute the mailx command via shell.



3. Glob Module (Standard Library):

Used for pattern matching and retrieving file paths in the specified directory.



4. Time Module (Standard Library):

For adding delays between sending emails (throttling).




Example Journal File:

Assume your journal files are stored in `/path/to/
