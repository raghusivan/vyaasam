Since I can only send emails from the approved sender email ID (commsurv), the journals will be sent as attachments.

Please see below for an example of how it will look.

We cannot send the journals directly as emails because the senders specified within them are different and not approved. For example, we cannot use xyn@mail.com, which is the sender used within the journal.

For now, I will send the journals as attachments. Sowndharya is working on the formatting, and once it's ready, I will share them with you.
