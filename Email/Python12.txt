To modify the JSON files to install Python 3.12 on an EC2 instance, you can add a UserData script in the EC2 configuration that will run commands to install Python 3.12 upon instance launch. Here's an example of how you might add this to your configuration:

1. Identify the LaunchConfiguration or Instance block in your JSON file where the EC2 instance properties are defined.


2. Add the UserData property to install Python 3.12.



Here's an example modification:

"LaunchConfiguration": {
    "Type": "AWS::AutoScaling::LaunchTemplate",
    "Properties": {
        "InstanceType": "{{component.ec2_instance_type}}",
        "UserData": {
            "Fn::Base64": {
                "Fn::Join": [
                    "",
                    [
                        "#!/bin/bash\n",
                        "yum update -y\n",
                        "yum install -y gcc openssl-devel bzip2-devel libffi-devel zlib-devel\n",
                        "cd /opt\n",
                        "wget https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.12.0/Python-3.12.0.tgz\n",
                        "tar xzf Python-3.12.0.tgz\n",
                        "cd Python-3.12.0\n",
                        "./configure --enable-optimizations\n",
                        "make altinstall\n",
                        "ln -s /usr/local/bin/python3.12 /usr/bin/python3.12\n"
                    ]
                ]
            }
        },
        "ImageId": "{{component.ec2_instance_operating_system}}"
    }
}

In this example:

The UserData section includes a script to install Python 3.12.

It updates the instance, installs necessary dependencies, downloads Python 3.12, compiles, and installs it.

Finally, it creates a symbolic link to make python3.12 accessible system-wide.


You may need to adjust the package manager and commands if your instances are not using Amazon Linux (or a compatible OS).
