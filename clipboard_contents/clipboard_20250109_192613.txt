Yes, I remember Ajiba mentioning that. I’m so glad that both Ajiba and Aji’s blessings will always be with her and Vyaas.

I’m eagerly looking forward to this occasion to spend an entire week with you, Rakshi, and everyone, just enjoying the time together.

There are still a few things to finalize for her and Vyaas. The plan is for the 16th; if not, she can wear what she had for Divya’s wedding.

As for the pavadais for all the occasions, they seem a bit boring. I’m considering a gown for the ring ceremony—let’s see how it goes!
