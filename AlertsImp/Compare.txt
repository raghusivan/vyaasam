## Introduction

This document provides a comprehensive comparison between **AWS Lambda** and **Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service)** for running the code to retrieve closed alerts from CSS (Centralized Security System), manipulate the JSON data, and transfer it to a shared folder for SourceOne. The code will be implemented in **Python**, considering its strengths in JSON manipulation and ease of integration with Airflow. This comparison takes into account programming language considerations, compute platform capabilities, security, logging, error handling, notifications, team expertise, cost, scalability, and performance.

- **Integration with Airflow:** 
  - The solution must be orchestrated and managed by Apache Airflow.
- **Security:** 
  - Ensure secure handling of data and credentials.
- **Logging and Monitoring:** 
  - Implement robust logging for auditing and troubleshooting.
- **Error Handling and Notifications:** 
  - Handle errors gracefully and send notifications as needed.

- **Isolation:** 
  - Functions are isolated, reducing the attack surface.
- **Secrets Management:** 
  - Integrates with AWS Secrets Manager and KMS.

#### EKS

- **Network Security:** 
  - Requires configuration of security groups and network policies.
- **IAM Integration:** 
  - More complex IAM roles for pods and services.
- **Secrets Management:** 
  - Requires additional tools like Kubernetes Secrets.

**Recommendation:** 

- **Lambda** offers simpler and more secure management of permissions and secrets, especially when combined with Python's ease of handling AWS services.

### Logging and Monitoring

#### Lambda
