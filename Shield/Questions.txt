Monitored Groups for Supervision: Detailed Explanation

What is a Monitored Group?

A monitored group in the context of Shield refers to a logical grouping of communication channels, users, or activities that are subject to surveillance and monitoring. These groups are defined based on specific criteria, such as departments, roles, geographic locations, or types of communication (e.g., email, voice, instant messages). Monitored groups enable organizations to streamline supervision, manage alerts effectively, and ensure compliance with regulatory or internal policies.

Examples of Monitored Groups

1. By Department: Grouping all communications for employees in the Compliance, Risk, or HR departments.


2. By Region: Monitoring activities based on geographic locations, such as "Asia-Pacific" or "North America."


3. By Communication Type: Separating email, voice, and chat communications into distinct monitored groups.


4. By Risk Level: Categorizing high-risk employees (e.g., traders) or high-sensitivity channels into specialized groups for closer supervision.

---

4. Does Shield support hierarchical or role-based access for monitored groups?

2. Does Shield support granular access control, such as read-only versus full administrative rights for groups?


3. Can multiple users collaborate on the same monitored group without compromising data security?


4. How are access controls audited to ensure compliance with internal and external policies?

Why Are Monitored Groups Important?

Monitored groups provide organizations like Macquarie with the ability to:

1. Tailor Surveillance: Focus on specific areas of risk or regulatory concern.


2. Streamline Workflows: Assign relevant teams to supervise specific groups based on their expertise.


3. Improve Efficiency: Quickly identify and act on high-risk or non-compliant communications.


4. Enhance Reporting: Break down compliance data by logical groupings for better analysis and presentation to regulators.



Next Steps

To further enhance understanding:

Request Shield’s documentation on setting up and managing monitored groups.

Inquire about live demonstrations or case studies showcasing how monitored groups have been used effectively by other organizations.

Test configurations of monitored groups during the implementation phase to ensure they align with Macquarie’s specific needs.
