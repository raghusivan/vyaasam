To find duplicate `_id` values in an Elasticsearch index, you typically cannot directly query Elasticsearch to identify duplicates since each document in an index is required to have a unique `_id`. However, in some situations, multiple Elasticsearch documents may have the same `_id` value in different indices, or there might be multiple documents with duplicate values in a different field that you want to identify.

If you are looking for duplicates based on the `_id` field or another field within the same index, we would need to:

1. Fetch all documents in the index or a subset of documents.
2. Identify duplicates by comparing these documents.

Here is a **shell script** to retrieve documents from an Elasticsearch index and identify duplicates based on the `_id` field or any other field.

### Shell Script: `find_duplicates.sh`

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Check if the Elasticsearch host is provided
if [ -z "$1" ]; then
  echo "Usage: $0 <es_host> <index_name>"
  echo "Example: $0 https://your_elasticsearch_host:9200 ecomm_production_20200929_message_types_2023-11-19"
  exit 1
fi

# Assign the Elasticsearch host and index name from the arguments
ES_HOST="$1"
INDEX_NAME="$2"

# Replace these with your actual credentials
USERNAME="your_username"
PASSWORD="your_password"

# Fetch all documents from the Elasticsearch index (limited by the "size" parameter)
QUERY='{
  "size": 10000,
  "_source": ["_id"], 
  "query": {
    "match_all": {}
  }
}'

# Execute the curl request to Elasticsearch
RESPONSE=$(curl -u "$USERNAME:$PASSWORD" --header "Content-Type: application/json" --location --request GET "$ES_HOST/$INDEX_NAME/_search" --data-raw "$QUERY")

# Parse the _id field from the response and count duplicates using awk
echo "$RESPONSE" | grep -o '"_id":"[^"]*"' | awk -F':' '{print $2}' | sort | uniq -cd
```

### Explanation:

1. **Script Parameters:**
   - The script accepts two arguments:
     - `$1`: Elasticsearch host URL.
     - `$2`: Elasticsearch index name.

2. **Fetch Documents:**
   - A query is constructed to fetch all documents from the specified index, limited by the `"size": 10000` parameter.
   - The script uses `match_all` to fetch all documents. This could be adjusted to apply any additional filters if needed.

3. **Parsing `_id` Field:**
   - The script uses `grep` to extract all occurrences of `_id` fields from the JSON response.
   - `awk` processes the extracted `_id` values and identifies duplicates.

4. **Display Duplicates:**
   - `sort` sorts the extracted IDs, and `uniq -cd` finds and displays only the duplicate IDs with their count.

### Running the Script:

1. **Save** the script as `find_duplicates.sh`.
2. **Make the script executable** by running:
   ```bash
   chmod +x find_duplicates.sh
   ```
3. **Run** the script with your Elasticsearch host and index name:
   ```bash
   ./find_duplicates.sh https://your_elasticsearch_host:9200 ecomm_production_20200929_message_types_2023-11-19
   ```

### Example Output:

```plaintext
  2 "MES-4bdad613948a126c-27d719800000"
  3 "MES-4bdad613948a126c-27d719800001"
  ...
```

- The output shows the count of each duplicate `_id` found in the index.

### Note:

- **Important Considerations**: Elasticsearch enforces unique `_id` values within an index, so if there are truly duplicate `_id` values within the same index, it might suggest that there were errors in indexing or that you are looking for duplicates across multiple indices or fields.
- **Adjust Query Size**: The size of the fetched documents (`10000` in the script) should be adjusted based on the total number of documents in your index. Be mindful of Elasticsearch's limits and performance considerations when fetching large numbers of documents.

To list all indices in Elasticsearch sorted in descending order based on their creation date, you can use the Elasticsearch **Cat API** (`_cat/indices`) combined with sorting capabilities in a shell script. The **Cat API** provides a way to retrieve metadata about the indices, including their creation dates.

### Shell Script: `list_indices_sorted.sh`

Here is the shell script to list indices sorted by their creation date in descending order:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Replace these with your actual credentials
USERNAME="your_username"
PASSWORD="your_password"

# Replace with your Elasticsearch host
ES_HOST="https://your_elasticsearch_host:9200"

# Use the Cat API to get the list of all indices with their creation dates
curl -s -u "$USERNAME:$PASSWORD" \
  --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --location --request GET "$ES_HOST/_cat/indices?h=index,creation.date.string&s=creation.date:desc" | awk '{print $1, $2}' 
```

### Explanation:

1. **`_cat/indices` Endpoint:**
   - This is an Elasticsearch Cat API endpoint that returns information about all indices, including their creation dates.
   - The **`?h=index,creation.date.string`** parameter specifies that we want to retrieve the index names and their creation dates.
   - The **`&s=creation.date:desc`** parameter sorts the indices by their creation date in descending order.

2. **`curl` Command:**
   - **`-s`**: Runs `curl` in silent mode to suppress progress information and only show the output.
   - **`-u`**: Supplies the username and password for authentication.

3. **`awk` Command:**
   - Used to format the output to display only the index name and its creation date.

### Instructions to Run the Script:

1. **Replace** `your_username`, `your_password`, and `your_elasticsearch_host` with your actual Elasticsearch credentials and host.
2. **Save** the script to a file, e.g., `list_indices_sorted.sh`.
3. **Make the script executable** by running:

   ```bash
   chmod +x list_indices_sorted.sh
   ```

4. **Run** the script:

   ```bash
   ./list_indices_sorted.sh
   ```

### Expected Output:

The output will list all the indices sorted by their creation date in descending order, displaying the index name and its creation date:

```plaintext
index_name_3 2023-09-01T15:30:00Z
index_name_2 202

If the Finder window always appears behind the Terminal when you run the shell script, you can use the `osascript` command with AppleScript to bring the Finder to the front explicitly. This script will force the Finder to become the active application, bringing the **Documents** folder to the foreground.

### **Step 1: Create or Edit the Shell Script**
1. Open the **Terminal** application.
2. Create a new shell script or edit an existing one:
   ```bash
   nano open_documents.sh
   ```

3. Add the following content to the script:

   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash
   # Shell script to open the Documents folder and bring Finder to the foreground

   # Open the Documents folder using Finder
   open ~/Documents

   # Use AppleScript to activate Finder and bring it to the front
   osascript -e 'tell application "Finder" to activate'
   ```

4. Save the file:
   - Press `Ctrl + O` to save.
   - Press `Enter` to confirm the file name.
   - Press `Ctrl + X` to exit the editor.

### **Step 2: Make the Script Executable**
1. Run the following command to make your script executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x open_documents.sh
   ```

### **Step 3: Run the Script**
1. Run the script by typing:
   ```bash
   ./open_documents.sh
   ```

### **Explanation:**
- The `open ~/Documents` command opens the **Documents** folder in Finder.
- The `osascript` command runs a small AppleScript snippet that tells the Finder to **activate**, which brings it to the front of all open windows.

### **Result:**
This approach will ensure that the **Finder** window displaying the **Documents** folder comes to the foreground, above the Terminal window.
