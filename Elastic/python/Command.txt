Here’s a simplified and cleaned version of the curl command, keeping only what’s required for the API call:

curl -X GET 'https://core1.uat.core.commsurv.syd.non.c1.macquarie.com/conduct_surveillance/api/ecomm_production_20200929/case_management/messages?start-datetime=2024-09-09T12:31:17.123&end-datetime=2024-10-09T12:31:17.123&status=QA%20Issue%20Incorrect%20Closure' \
-H 'Authorization: Basic YXJmYWtkMGRh2FXFkTBYu9ZnN2UjMlA=' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json'

Explanation of Kept Components:

1. URL: The API endpoint including query parameters (start-datetime, end-datetime, status).


2. Authorization Header: Contains the base64-encoded credentials for authentication.


3. Content-Type: Specifies the type of content being requested or sent (JSON in this case).


4. HTTP Method: Explicitly specifies the GET method (-X GET), which is optional for curl but clarifies intent.



Removed Components:

Cookies: Not needed unless required explicitly by the API for session handling.

Headers like Accept-Language, Cache-Control: These are generally optional and not necessary for API authentication.

Browser-Specific Headers: Removed User-Agent, Sec-Fetch-*, and other browser-related headers, as these are irrelevant for API calls.


Usage:

Run this command directly in your terminal, replacing the Authorization value with your actual base64-encoded credentials if necessary.
