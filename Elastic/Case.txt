To modify your script to run in 30-day spans from January to October, here's the updated script. It will iterate through the months, automatically setting the start and end dates in the required format:

#!/bin/bash

# Authorization header
AUTH_HEADER="Authorization: Basic YWRtaW46dGVzdHBhc3N3b3Jk"

# Base URL
URL="https://coral.ust.com.coresvcsnuc.syd.nocn.csl.macquarie.com/conduct_surveillance/api/ecomm_production_20200929/case_management/messages"

# Loop through months from January to October
for MONTH in {01..10}; do
  # Generate 30-day spans for the current month
  START_DATE="2024-${MONTH}-01T12:31:17.123"
  if [[ "$MONTH" == "10" ]]; then
    END_DATE="2024-${MONTH}-31T12:31:17.123"
  else
    END_DATE=$(date -d "2024-${MONTH}-01 +30 days" +%Y-%m-%dT12:31:17.123)
  fi
  
  # Construct the full URL with query parameters
  FULL_URL="${URL}?start-datetime=${START_DATE}&end-datetime=${END_DATE}&status=${STATUS}"

  # Execute the curl command
  curl "${FULL_URL}" -H "${AUTH_HEADER}"
done

Key Points:

This script loops through months from January to October ({01..10}).

It sets the START_DATE for the 1st of each month.

For months other than October, the script calculates a 30-day span.

For October, the END_DATE is hardcoded as the 31st to account for the specific month length.


You can save this script and execute it. Adjust the STATUS value if required before running. Let me know if you'd like further enhancements.
