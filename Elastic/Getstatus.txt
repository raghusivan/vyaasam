Here's a Linux shell script to retrieve all documents with the same parent from an Elasticsearch index, where the size (number of results) is passed as a command-line parameter.

Linux Shell Script: Retrieve All Documents with the Same Parent

#!/bin/bash

# Check if the correct number of arguments is provided
if [ "$#" -ne 5 ]; then
  echo "Usage: $0 <INDEX_NAME> <USERNAME> <PASSWORD> <PARENT_ID> <SIZE>"
  exit 1
fi

# Assign command-line arguments to variables
INDEX_NAME="$1"
USERNAME="$2"
PASSWORD="$3"
PARENT_ID="$4"
SIZE="$5"

# Get current timestamp for the file name
TIMESTAMP=$(date +"%Y%m%d%H%M%S")

# Define the output file name with the current timestamp
OUTPUT_FILE="parent_results_${TIMESTAMP}.json"

# Elasticsearch query to search for documents with the same parent
ES_QUERY="{
  \"query\": {
    \"term\": {
      \"parent.keyword\": \"$PARENT_ID\"
    }
  },
  \"size\": $SIZE
}"

# Execute the curl command to perform the search
curl -s -u $USERNAME:$PASSWORD -X GET "http://localhost:9200/$INDEX_NAME/_search" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "$ES_QUERY" -o "$OUTPUT_FILE"

# Check if the curl command was successful
if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
  echo "Search for documents with parent ID '$PARENT_ID' completed successfully, and results are saved to $OUTPUT_FILE"
else
  echo "Error: Failed to perform the search on Elasticsearch"
fi

How to Use the Script:

1. Save the Script:

Save the script to a file, e.g., search_parent.sh.



2. Make the Script Executable:

chmod +x search_parent.sh


3. Run the Script with Command-Line Arguments:

./search_parent.sh <INDEX_NAME> <USERNAME> <PASSWORD> <PARENT_ID> <SIZE>

Replace <INDEX_NAME>, <USERNAME>, <PASSWORD>, <PARENT_ID>, and <SIZE> with the actual values. For example:


./search_parent.sh my_index es_user es_password "MES-4bc2485ca17b8d6c-ffa9f4700000000" 100



Explanation of the Script:

Command-Line Arguments:

The script takes five command-line arguments:

INDEX_NAME: The name of the Elasticsearch index to search.

USERNAME and PASSWORD: Credentials for accessing Elasticsearch.

PARENT_ID: The parent ID to search for.

SIZE: The number of results to return.



Elasticsearch Query:

The term query searches for all documents with the specified parent ID. The size parameter specifies the number of documents to return.


Curl Execution:

The curl command is executed locally to perform the search using the query defined in the script. The results are saved to a file with a name that includes the current timestamp.


Error Handling:

The script checks if the curl command executed successfully and provides appropriate feedback.



Notes:

Execute on Remote Machine:

This script is designed to be run directly on the machine where Elasticsearch is hosted.


Flexible Query Input:

By using command-line arguments, the script allows for flexibility and easy modification of the search criteria without changing the script itself.
